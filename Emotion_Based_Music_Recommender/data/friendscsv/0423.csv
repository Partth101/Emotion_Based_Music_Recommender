"Who are you saying "check" too?"
"Myself. Y’know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a goodthing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird."

"Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)"
"There it is."
"Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-handside. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator…"

"So-so come! Why don’t you come?"
"What?!"
"To London! Come to London. Please? It’ll mean so much to me."
"Yeah, well, I gotta work, I’m sorry."
"Why-why can’t you take a couple of days off?"
"Because, I can’t! Ross, I told you, no. I can’t."
"This is my wedding."
"All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go!Let’s go! Let’s go!!"
"Fine. You’ll-you’ll watch it on video when we get back."

"Oh, do you need a hug? You don’t have to bring me anything!"
"Come on! Do something!"
"I am, I’m ignoring you."
"Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. Allright, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his "pop-up" map ofLondon. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)"
"Oh, what the hell is that?"
"It’s London, baby! All right, the hotel’s here. (Points to themap.) Wait. No, we wanna go… No. I know. (Sets the map down.) I’m gonna have togo into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)"
"Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!"
"I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go."
"Okay. Listen-listen, we’re not gonna have to walk this way theentire time are we?"
"Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)"
"…and that was all before 10 o’clock. The caterer rang and saidit was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phonedto say there aren’t any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome.We’re not gonna be…"
"Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?"
"Well, up yours too!"
"What?! No! No! That’s-that’s time-out!"
"Sorry."
"Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything’s gonna be great, okay? Come on.Come on."
"Chicken Kiev?"
"Um-hmm! Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute?"
"Yeah, y’know, but something like salmon which would be so much moreelegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn’t have to worry about the salmonella. (Rosspushes her.) So, I can’t wait to see this place you’re getting married!"
"Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily’s parents got marriedhere."
"I still can’t believe they’re tearing it down. It really is themost lovely building you’ll ever see. I mean it’s over… (She stopssuddenly, when she sees that demolition has already started.) Oh my God!"
"It’s nice."
"Oh. Oh. (She starts running towards the building.)"
"(running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? Whatare we going to do?"
"It’s all right! Everything’s gonna be all right."
"How’s it gonna be all right?!"
"Uh-huh, I see that."
"(entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found outwhat happened."
"What? What?"
"They torn it down a few days early."
"All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I’ve ever seen.Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey,Chandler?"
"I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’rethinking of changing the name of this place."
"Really? To what?"
"To Put the Camera Away!!!"
"Man,"
"Oh. Oh."
"Oh, honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?"
"Oh, no. Oh, nothing."
"Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything."
"Okay, I have a wedgie."
"Okay, that is all you."
"So-so, what do you want for lunch?"
"Oh, I don’t know. I guess we"
"Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?"
"I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. Ishouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me."
"Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in lovewith was getting married…"
"(interrupting) Still in love with?!"
"Yeah!"
"I’m not in love with Ross!"
"Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither."
"Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is myex-boyfriend and that would be"
"We thought you knew!"
"We?!"
"Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!"
"You all know? Does Ross know?"
"Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything."
"Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!"
"Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, thatwould be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean.""
"Hey!"
"So, what are you guys in the market for? We’ve got uh, scarves,tulip post cards..."
"Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag onthe front of it.) Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?"
"Well, I don’t have to buy that, "I’m with stupid"T-shirt anymore."
"Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)"
"All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you?Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?"
"Oh, I embarrass you?"
"How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?"
"He’s just jealous. You’ll fit right in; all Londoners wearthem!"
"Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?"
"(looks around) They’re all tourists."
"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public,y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
"Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you’re gonna make me choose betweenyou and the hat? I choose the hat."
"Good choice."
"Thanks."
"Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. Iam not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower standand walks away trying to be cool.)"
"Hello?"
"Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to thinkwe’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding."
"We don’t have to."
"Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?"
"No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hallbeing knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit."
"She said what?"
"She said, "If I’m not gonna be happy getting married somewherethat we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.""
"Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parentsspent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends thatpeople took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He putshis pants on backwards.) This isn’t right."
"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m surethey’ll come back when we can do it right."
"I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?(Holds out his pants)"
"Don’t you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) Wehave no choice! Anywhere that’s half-decent would’ve be booked months ago, Rossdon’t you understand? This is our wedding I’m talking about."
"The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This iswhen we’re getting married."
"So what are you saying? It’s now or never?"
"No. I’m saying it’s now. (He starts putting on his pants,backwards again.)"
"Or?"
"There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!"
"It’s not the pants. It’s you that is backwards. And if, and ifyou don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps weshouldn’t get married at all! (She storms out.)"
"(chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No,wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—(He catches something important in thezipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)"
"Hey!"
"(depressed) Hi."
"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?"
"Manhattan does not have enough stores."
"Well,"
"You can?"
"Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross."
"Um-hmm."
"And a small piece of chocolate."
"Okay."
"And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)"
"Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with somegraveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?"
"Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you,the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay,I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all ofthe bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws."
"I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out."
"Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that Ilove Ross, I think he’s such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabsit out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Rossokay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running yourhands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh grossit’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck! Hah?"
"I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much,and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy."
"Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s trysome uh, aversion therapy."
"Okay."
"Okay?"
"All right."
"So uh, now look at the picture…"
"Okay."
"All right, and umm… (She grabs the picture and smacks her in thehead.)"
"Ow!"
"Okay, how do you feel now?"
"Well, I like"
"Hey."
"Hey. (He nods at the hat.)"
"Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!"
"No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that youwere embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel anybetter, I’ve had a really lousy day."
"Me too."
"Yeah?"
"Noo!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)"
"(on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat."
"(Yep, Sarah, the Duchess of York) Okay, so umm, what’s yourfriend’s name?"
"(on tape) Oh, Chandler."
"Hi Chandler! (Waves)"
"That’s… That’s was…"
"Oh my God!"
"That’s Fergie baby!!"
"Joey says you don’t really like his hat, but I think it’skinda dashing."
"How did you? How? How?"
"Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?So, I’m in my map and-and…(Ross enters) Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily."
"(laughs) Yes, I did! And"
"Am I?! And was it"
"Umm…"
"I’m gonna go to the bathroom."
"Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)"
"Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s apickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding atall?"
"She said that?!"
"Yeah."
"Why?!"
"I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding justbecause the hall was gone and she liked flipped out."
"Oh my God. You’re even dumber than"
"Excuse me?"
"Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?"
"I don’t know. A month?"
"Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since thefirst time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That’s what wedid! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfectfour-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross getsthrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the mostimportant part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all thatother stuff was."
"I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys werejust doing the flying nun."
"Sometimes we were."
"Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?"
"Okay."
"Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)"
"That was pretty intense huh?"
"Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didn’t think that we just went inthere because we were uncomfortable being out here!"
"(glares at him) I hope he did!"
"Hello."
"(on phone) Hey, Pheebs! It’s Joey!"
"Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks justlike you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then Ifigured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you."
"That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how thechick and the duck are doing?"
"Ohh, they’re having a"
"Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun."
"So you’re not homesick yet?"
"No, I don’t think so."
"All right, the seven of us miss you."
"Who’s seven?"
"Y’know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies…"
"Ahh, the babies miss me?"
"Ooh, the pizza guy’s here!"
"What? You ordered pizza without me?!"
"Yeah. But y’know we were thinking about you, y’know we orderedthe Joey Special."
"Two pizzas?!"
"Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later."
"Wait, well, where did you get it from?!"
"Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!"
"You’ll see."
"I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen."
"Oh God."
"Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y’know fewerbricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles…"
"And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a littlealcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and… (Points to Ross) Yougo."
"But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other placeat any other time. Really, it’s fine, whatever you want."
"It’s perfect."
"And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain…"
"Well then we’ll get wet. (They kiss.)"
"Ohh. And I don’t even have a date."
"Pheebs?"
"Yeah?"
"Do you remember where the duck food is?"
"Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink. Why?"
"(enters with a bag packed) Because I’m going to London."
"What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?"
"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, youdon’t have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.)"
"I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!"
"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel!He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision."
"That’s not why you’re going! You’re going because youhope he’s gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that Britishchippy.""
"Ohh—Do you think he will?!"
"No! Because he’s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, ifyou go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y’know,it’s too late! You missed you’re chance! I’m sorry, I know this must bereally hard, it’s over."
"Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, "Ido." (Exits)"
"I do! I do! I do! (Chases her into the hall, but Rachel doesn’tstop.) I do! (Gives up.) Ugh, like I can really chase you. I’m carrying a litter."
"Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily’s Parents’ house."
"Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it’s not politeto make fun of people. Goodbye."
"Joey, it’s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick,Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself."
