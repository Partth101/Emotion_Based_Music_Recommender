"Hey Rachel!"
"Is Joey here?"
"I don’t see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?"
"I don’t see him. Hey! Maybe he’s in the sugar bowl! (Opens thesugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)"
"Well, at least you make each other laugh."
"What’s up?"
"Well, I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how hey’know… I don’t know, I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel onthe floor?"
"We were playing a game."
"Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind ofsituation?"
"Sure."
"What?! No! No!"
"All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell himuh…tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)"
"(To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?"
"Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler)Dude, I don’t know. That’s a pretty small hole."
"Honey, you gotta talk to her."
"I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like toput yourself out there like that and just get shot down."
"(incredulous) I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!""
"Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are meanwhen they’re hungry."
"All right so, so what do I do?"
"This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk toher again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try."
"Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.)Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your…"
"(interrupting him) We didn’t play it!!"
"Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at yourleaves and tell you your fortune."
"I didn’t know you read tea leaves."
"Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I wasso accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life isit’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give methe trots."
"Okay, I’m done. Read mine."
"Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book)Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death."
"(stunned) I-I’m the head chef. I-I can’t get promoted."
"Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who’s next?"
"Okay, I’m done. Do mine."
"Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle."
"Ah."
"Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you’re having a babyor you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!"
"Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab."
"What does yours say Pheebs?"
"Umm… Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, I’mgonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probablynot the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)"
"(entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down, like a,like a faded salmon?"
"You mean your pink shirt?"
"Faded salmon color."
"No, I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt."
"Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!"
"Well, I’m sure you get another one at"
"That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!"
"Well just ask Mona to give it back!"
"I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that wedidn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoringthe one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walksaway.)"
"(noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait asecond you guys…for the last couple weeks I’ve been that guy everywhere I go. Wetake the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s thetea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)"
"Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!(Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of"
"Hi!"
"Hey."
"Hi."
"Hi."
"Tea gives Phoebe the trots."
"So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it’snot even like we know how to be with each other anymore."
"I know it’s tough now, but things will get better."
"How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, tothe point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!"
"I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcasticcomment? Some cheese?"
"Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?"
"Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just putit in the nearest one."
"Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?"
"In the James Taylor case."
"Where is the James Taylor CD?"
"Honey, I’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them inthe right case."
"Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we’rejust gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases."
"Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind oforder. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?"
"Hmm, I don’t know. We really have to talk this through."
"Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!"
"Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on thisuncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see himtry to get him talking about something else."
"Oh yeah. That makes sense."
"Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that youneed his advice on."
"Ooh, I can do that."
"Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the"
"They were just giving those away at the store (off Monica’s look)in exchange for money."

"Yeah Joey she’s…Rachel’s got this really big workproblem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! (To Chandler) Y’know what, if we’regonna make dinner we’re gonna have to leave. Yeah. (She and Chandler exit.)"
"So you uh, have a…big work problem?"
"Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’sy’know—It’s nothing."
"Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think I’m gonna take off."
"Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something.It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss."
"Yeah?"
"Yeah, and umm my baby."
"Yeah?"
"My boss wants to buy my baby!"
"What?! Oh my-oh my God!"
"I know I told you, it’s a really big problem."
"What he wants to buy your baby?!"
"Can you believe that?!"
"That’s crazy!"
"That’s what I told him!"
"Okay, how did this even happen?"
"Well I’ll tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and hiswife—They-they can’t have children. So umm, and that—we were at theChristmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy yourbaby.""
"Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figuredit was something about maternity leave."
"Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would’ve been a much simplerproblem."
"Oh hello."
"Oh, it’s you. I see you everywhere. I’m Jim, Jim Nelson."
"Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly havebeen seeing a lot of each other lately."
"We have. Maybe we’ll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night,say around 8 o’clock?"
"Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around andthe exchange information.)"
"Mona? (There’s no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers whereher extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. Helooks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to hisbrain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth tosqueal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses thekey to open the door and enter Mona’s apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)"
"(entering, with her date) I am so sorry I spilled wine all over yourshirt."
"Oh, it’s okay."
"No, it’s still wet. Y’know what? Let me get it out before itsets. Ooh, I have something you can wear. Here. (Hands him Ross’s shirt.)"
"Oh umm, I-I don’t know if I want to wear a woman’s shirt."
"No-no that’s a man’s shirt."
"It’s awfully pink. (Ross mouths, "It’ssalmon!")"
"Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copiesof the"
"Honey, both yours."
"(entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!"
"Yeah? The work problem?"
"Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again."
"What problem did you tell him you had?"
"Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I thinkeverything’s gonna be okay."
"May I help you?"
"Do you think you can just"
"Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as ifsomeone really wants us to be together."
"Someone does. Me."
"Oh, witty banter. Well done."
"So, tell me a little bit about yourself."
"Oh okay, well I’m a masseuse, and I used to work at thisplace…"

"Oh stop it."
"And your breasts! Hmm!!!"
"Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’mgoing to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants tobe together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me aboutyourself."
"All right."
"Okay."

"Let’s just say I took care of it."
"Whoa-whoa-whoa, let’s say more!"

"What?! Why?!"
"So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t beawkward!"
"And you couldn’t think of anything else?!"
"You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!"

"You can always sell your baby."

"That’s not your regular dry cleaners."
"I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so Ihave to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adultbookstore, a new grocery store…"
"What?!"
"A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guyand that’s what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there I’m going to kicksome ass."

"(To Phoebe) Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s…(looks at Phoebe.)Wow!"
"What?"
"I’m sorry, it’s just that you’re so incredibly beautiful."
"Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going todo?"
"I hope you don’t think I’m crazy but I feel like I was meant topick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?"

"(to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?"
"(looking around) She must’ve left."
"Hi."
"So? What-what-what happened?"
"It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’mnot suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as Iunderstand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any otherchild I should bear."
"Wow,"
"Chandler, can you give us a minute?"
"Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?"
"Yeah."
"I’ll be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)"
"Joey, I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying tomake things…"
"I know. I know."
"It kinda worked. I mean y’know, I don’t know about you buy Ihaven’t thought about our thing since all this."
"Hey you’re right. Yeah, it’s kinda been like us again a littlebit."
"Yeah I know! I miss that."
"Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myselfout there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about meand-and how it was really awkward."
"My gynecologist tried to kill me."
"(on phone) Item J437-A, color: winterberry. (There’s a knock on thedoor as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm, listen come here, come in.(She does so.) I’m so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I’m really sorry. It’sjust that I… (He picks up the pink shirt.)"
"(interrupting him) Listen Ross, you don’t have to apologize. Iunderstand why you were there."
"You do?"
"Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still havefeelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can’t. It’stoo complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meantto be."
"(faking starting to cry) Oh God you’re right."
"Ross, we…we have to be strong. Okay, I-I’m gonna go. (She picksup the shirt Ross has just set down.) Can I? To remember you?"
