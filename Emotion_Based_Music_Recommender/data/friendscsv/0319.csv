"Oh, this is so great."
"Yeah, it was."

"Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller."
"So the ah, play’s pretty great, huh?"

"Dr. Drake Remoray."
"No, that’s not it. So, you’re a soap actor? Well this must bepretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?"

"I know."
"What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
"Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no."
"Huh."
"I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing thisGunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’mstanding there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him,which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Rossor something."
"Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet andyou have issues with your father."
"I don’t have any issues with my Father."
"Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then."
"I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company aboutthat info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, andwhenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me."
"(entering) Hello."
"Hey!"
"So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute."
"Wow, what-what do you think she wants?"
"Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life withoutme.... a-sucks."
"It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if Ibroke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive."
"Then be supportive like a guy."
"(in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I’d miss you."
"Hi."
"Hi!"
"You ah, wanted to see me?"
"Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)"

"Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, justsort of stuff that you’ve left here."
"What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?"
"No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know,move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?"
"Yes."
"Yeah?"
"Yes, I do."
"Good."
"Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-thiswas a gift?!"
"Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop."
"It’s still a gift! I got it from the"
"Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug."
"No!! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where,where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, thisbook is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too.Yes, I do."
"You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where thatT-shirt!"

"You are so just doing this out of spite."
"Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!"
"Huh?"
"I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (hekisses the shirt)"
"You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t evenfit you anymore!"
"Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah..."
"(imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!"
"Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put onthe T-shirt. It’s an old ‘Frankie says relax’ T-shirt, that barely fitshim. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don’t mind I’mgonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have apleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)"
"So, you’re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)"
"And you’re our age. You’re our age."
"Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just nameit after yourself."
"What like Pete Dakota?"
"Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete."
"Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago."
"That’s not a state Joe."
"Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?"
"I got to go, so ah, I’ll see you guys later."
"Okay."
"You’re our age!"
"(to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?"
"Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his headand says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I’m runningout of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am Ionly attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, orthey’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me,and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean,seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!"
"Yeah, kinda."
"Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?"
"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh?Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You lookat me, and it’s nothin’. (He kisses her) Nothing."
"Tasty! I’m really starting to feel like you guys have ahistory, it’s-it’s nice."
"I have a question about this scene."
"Yes?"
"Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor."
"Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking."
"Yeah."
"I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason thanthat."
"Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'knowah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the scripthere that you’re a bitch."
"It doesn’t say that in the script."
"It does in mine!"
"I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, Istill wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thingon the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?"
"You bug me."
"Is there any chance you didn’t see that?"
"Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through thepeep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!"
"I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d sayno, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!"
"You didn’t just break up."
"Hey, it’s been like three weeks!"
"You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. Imean bullets have left guns slower!"
"Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight,I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this. (turns away,then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go,she’s going in."
"Okay."
"She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! Thedoor’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!"
"And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave."
"Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!"
"Stop what?!"
"I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there willdo it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!"
"No!! You can’t!!"
"Look, they must be stopped!"
"I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!(Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisinglystrong!"
"I need juice! People need juice!!"
"Look man!"
"People need juice!"
"Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds thedoor shut with his feet.)"
"Juice, I need..."
"She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonnabe somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole,"
"Yeah, okay."
"Okay."
"It’s just I miss her so much."
"I know. (He rubs Ross’s head)"
"Why do all you’re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?"
"Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them ismissing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’"
"Y'know what?"
"No. And I don’t think I’m gonna want to."
"I can’t do this."
"Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know."
"Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair toyou."
"Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I amhere for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch.Right here!"
"Oh God. I’m sorry about this."
"That’s okay."
"You sure?"
"Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself."
"...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And sotoday, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It istruly ironic, on one hand consider the size..."
"(to Monica) Hey, can I ask you something?"
"Sure."
"Where are we?"
"(looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m gonnasay, midget rodeo."
"Just tell me the truth."
"Okay. Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told youthis, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship."
"Oh, yeah. Wasn’t that like a year ago?"
"So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm,the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus onme. Y'know what I mean?"
"Oh, yeah. I know that."
"I so wanna be attracted to you."
"But you’re not. Okay, good."
"I’m sorry."
"Y'know what, don’t be. This is not, don’t be, ‘causeit’s not so bad."
"It’s not?"
"I know I’m no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someonewho find attractive, I’m just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feelingdifferently."
"Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, youseem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too."
"Yeah, stupidly charming isn’t’ it? Well listen let’s, youwanna get something to eat? ‘Cause this place is kinda"
"And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker."
"(to Monica) One second."
"I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.(He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like agunfighter in a Western.)"
"(to Joey) I wasn’t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwinghis stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?"
"Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like thegreatest actress since, since, sliced bread!"
"Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth."
"God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m sotalented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell sogood.’"
"I think somebody has a crush on somebody."
"Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?"
"I’m talking about you. You big, big freak."
"Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind."
"Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If youwere in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!"
"Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexualscenarios and stuff huh?!"
"Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?"
"Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh?Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’.You look at me, and nothin’. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing."
"You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we’re gonna pick it uphere, tomorrow."
"Well, that was ah..."
"Better?"
"Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G’night."

"‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name."
"It isn’t?"
"No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man.Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man."
"Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey, Rach, how was work?"
"Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair."
"By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff."
"Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw itout, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)"
"Something wrong?"
"(She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and takea deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)"
"So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?"
"Okay well, he would turn things to gold."
"What about things that are already gold?"
"Ahh, his work is done."
"Okay, let’s play my game now."
"Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kickup the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)"
