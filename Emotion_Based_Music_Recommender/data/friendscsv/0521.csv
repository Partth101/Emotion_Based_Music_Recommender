"So, what are you gonna do?"
"I don't know. I'll just handle it—I'll ask you to talk to him!"
"Me?! Why me?"
"Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make himscared like you! Make him a…man!"
"I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'ma lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be."
"That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to hertea.)"
"(To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care ofit. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away henods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)"

"Yeah? How much?"
"A thousand bucks."
"ON A CAT??!!!!"
"It's not a cat!"
"All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was alittle girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lapand purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!"
"Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a littlepolitical here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are"
"It's not a cat!"
"Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't carewhat you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They bothglare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!"
"(To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see howlong we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?"
"Uhh, the ball thing."
"Yeah?"
"Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours withoutdropping it?!"
"Uhh,"
"Okay!"
"(catches the ball) Uh-oh."
"What?"
"I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!"
"Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!"
"I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, okay?"
"Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)"
"Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?"
"Gary, I'm here to report a crime."
"Yeah?"
"It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together."
"(laughs, then suddenly serious) What's up?"
"Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in withyou and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me."
"Sure. Okay."
"Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you twoare gonna be y'know, live-living together!"
"Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy."
"You mean scared."
"No, I mean happy."
"Scared? Happy?"
"Chandler, what-what are you doing?"
"I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you livedwith Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go tobed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!"
"I know! I can't wait!"
"Were you're parents happy, or something?"
"Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to findsomeone that I really love. I just—I wanna be around her as much as I can."
"Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary."
"So you know what I'm talking about, right?"
"Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move inwith her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!"
"No, it's too soon for you guys."
"(pause) Yeah, you're right about that."
"…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon theydiscovered what"
"Maybe this should be more of a quiet game."
"(entering) Hey guys!"
"Hi!"
"Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter)It was right here, where is it?"
"I don't know."
"All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!"
"How do you know? You don't have a watch."
"Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute andjust help me find it!"
"Oh, I don't know…. Yeah, can't do it."
"What?!"
"Monica, whatever you do, do"
"Yeah, we haven't dropped it in… (Looks to Ross.)"
"2 hours, 27 minutes."
"Really?!"
"(on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it intowork today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch itway over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sickagain) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs upand keeps throwing the ball.)"
"Hey Rach!"
"Hey."
"Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!"
"Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time."
"Rach?"
"Yeah?"
"You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms arecovered with scratches.)"
"Well, it's my cat."
"(shocked) What?!"
"Oh yeah, I got a cat."
"I don't want a cat!"
"Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat."
"Yeah."
"You guys this cat is"
"Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat."
"(To Rachel) What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me300!!"
"Well, I was gonna let you play with it."
"Hi!"
"Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?"
"Yes I did, and I think you should do it."
"What?!"
"He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very luckylady."
"You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the"
"I’m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him."
"Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out ofhere, good for nothing."
"Hey Chandler."
"Hey Gar!"
"(To Phoebe) Hi sweetie. (Kisses her.) Hi, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.)"
"You look very pretty today."
"Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)"
"Here's the thing."
"Yeah?"
"Y'know I"
"Uh-hmm."
"Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards."
"No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just stayingstill. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.)"
"Phoebe?"
"Yeah?"
"I want you to move in with me."
"That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I meanthere's so much we don't know about each other."
"(disappointed) Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it."
"I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for."
"(disappointed more) Uh-huh."
"I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worriedit's gonna be a big mistake."
"(on the verge of tears) Yeah."
"Which is why my answer is yes!"
"(suddenly happy) Really?!"
"Uh-huh! (They hug.) I'm so…happy. (She's not happy.)"
"(catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the sameteam!"
"Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?"
"That's right baby."
"All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in thegame.)"
"(jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!"
"What?"
"He's a dropper!"
"Oh yeah, that's right!"
"I'm not a dropper!"
"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?"
"It's throwing and catching!"
"All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)"
"Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses controland almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)"
"Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!"
"Oh my—Oh good God!"
"(she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, Idon't know what I'm going to do with this thing!"
"Baking it didn't help, huh?"
"So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?"
"I tried! They won't take her back."
"Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ."
"Rach, why won't they take it back?"
"Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean,what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?"
"Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out whatto do with it."
"No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm allscratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)"
"Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! Myvision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay.It's okay. Man, that was close."
"Yeah, you almost overreacted to something."
"Hey!"
"We have"
"We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!"
"Congratulations! Congrats!"
"I know, I'm so excited!"
"So am I!"
"Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the"
"Okay, I'll see you at the station later."
"Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!"
"All right."
"So you're moving in with him. What happened?"
"I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I"
"Why, do you write him a lot?"
"No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost ofstamps. Don't they?"
"Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!"
"Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out."
"Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in BrooklynHeights?"
"No, nothing."
"Oh really?"
"Yeah."
"Nothing at all?"
"No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn'thave a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)"
"Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Uh-huh!"
"Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right? (Closes the door and takesoff his coat.)"
"(sits down) Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together."
"So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right?You-you checked the"
"Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?"
"In a minute. You-you checked today's"
"Umm, yeah! Today's."
"'Cause uh, this is today's"
"(looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were justbragging!"
"Let me tell you what I think might be going on. (Phoebe looks down inshame.) No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. (Points to his eyes and she doesso) Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said,"Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone.Does that sound at all possible to you?"
"Yes. Yes! Fine! I"
"Phoebe…"
"Yeah?"
"Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it"
"That's so sweet."
"Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine!We don't have to move in together. I just—I want you to be happy"
"Living with you would make me happy."
"Phoebe, you"
"No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!"
"Are you sure?"
"Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!(Hugs him.)"
"Oh that's great!"
"Oh wait, one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind theglass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of theserooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!"
"Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.)"
"(looks into the box) Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!"
"It's not a baby! It's a cat!"
"Eew! It's creepy looking!"
"Oh no! No! It's actually—it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look!(Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?"
"(laughs) No, I hate cats."
"Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! Allright? Move on!"
"Wow! What an unusual cat!"
"Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?"
"Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to goto the shelter (Good for her) but… Okay, why not?"
"Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000."
"What?!"
"Okay, a thousand."
"I thought you wanted to adopt your cat."
"Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as moreof an investment than a cat."
"Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat. (Starts to leave.)"
"(makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously youknow how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't callthe cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leavethe money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled)Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at heragain, it sounds like Rachel) Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?"
"I'm starving!"
"Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-checktime!"
"I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We (Ross and him) inventedthis game!"
"Please! I made this game what it is."
"Not fun anymore?"
"I'm still hungry!"
"All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one handright? Are you with me?"
"I am!"
"All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guysall stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later."
"Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!"
"It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh, I uh sold Mrs.Whiskerson."
"Oh, thank God!"
"Did you get your money back?"
"Yeah, 15 hundred dollars."
"Wow! You made a profit!"
"(entering with the cat) I just came for the red-velvet pillow."
"Oh yeah, there you go. (Hands over the pillow.)"
"Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytimeyou want."
"Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)"
"(To Ross) Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?"
"I really like waking up with you."
"I like waking up with you too. (Looks out the window) Oh! It's such abeautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window) Oh, I can stay here allday."
"That would be great!"
"We could have breakfast in bed…"
"Wait, just a second."
"Okay. (He grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) Oh! Oh no."
"All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!"

"He shot a bird!"
"Oh that is over!"
"That's terrible! I'm sorry!"
"Phoebe, are you okay?"
"Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright."
"Oh hey, here Pheebs. (He throws her the ball.)"
"(catches it) Nah, I don't feel like playing. (She sets the ball down onthe table and everyone gasps.)"
"It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No oneneeds to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only officialballplayers can drop the ball!"
"All right. Okay. I'm starving! (They all get up, thus officially ending thegame.)"
"Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?"
"Yeah!"
"Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the doorand everyone watches her leave.)"
"You guys wanna eat here?"
"Yeah! As long as we're here!"
"Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ballaround?"
"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long."
"I know. My arm is killing me."
"No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)"
"Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm"
