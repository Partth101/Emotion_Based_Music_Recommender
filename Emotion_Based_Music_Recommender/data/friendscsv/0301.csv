"Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one ofRichard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so."
"Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all Icould hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or aopossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make thephone call."

"Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in yourcereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it downthe drain.)"
"God, what is wrong with me."
"You need to get some sleep."
"I need to get some Richard."
"Monica, you broke up with him for a reason."
"I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired ofwondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!"
"Maybe, because you told him not to."
"What are you the memory woman?"
"(entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breakingup. He didn't blink or anything."
"Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together,they're really cute."

"There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? Allright who's first? Huh? Ross?"
"Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy,so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her."

"(she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering...."
"Hmm?"

"Oh, really, let me see, let me see."

"Hey!"
"Wheel!"
"Of!"
"Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!"
"You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I gotthree tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?"
"I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?"
"No, Janice."
"Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always gotogether, we're like the three hocke-teers."
"You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have aproblem with Janice?"
"No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandlerfollows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from theGreek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?"
"Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!"
"Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know."
"Well, there you go."
"Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive younuts before too, remember?"
"Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing.Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters."
"Look, what do you want me to say?"
"I want you to say that you like her!"
"I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she startslaughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can havesomething to throw at her."
"Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and bythe way there is no Count Rushmore!"
"Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?(Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')"
"How could you have told her?"
"Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
"Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
"Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?"
"Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us."
"Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each othereverything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all thatlocker room stuff."
"That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Whodid it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'."
"Were both of those Joey?"
"Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, yourgirlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her."
"Not even with your best friend."
"Noo!"
"That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bondingand the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the samething you are."
"Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?"
"Pretty much."
"Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about thenight of five times?"
"Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol."
"I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think."
"( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to theplinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell meyour happy place."
"Richard's living room, drinking wine."
"All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. Andget out!"
"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
"Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have toask that you don't move anything."
"All right, I'll try not to."
"Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky...."
"Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?"
"All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, thewarm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees...."
"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
"All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, notpermitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, andthe, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook...."
"Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee."
"So, I hear, you hate me!"
"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
"A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm offand throw it at me."
"And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there..."
"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something aboutour little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality timetogether."
"But what does that gonna do..."
"For Chandler!"
"Okay. I'm in."
"Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's"
"Does it have to be a whole day?"
"Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me."
"Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room."
"(crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it wasthose videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War."
"Monica, do you want us to take you home?"
"Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica,and Phoebe leave)"
"Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?"
"Umm, yeah."
"No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique,stamina, girth...."
"Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?"
"Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doingit. Do you wanna?"
"We're not gonna talk about girth are we?"
"Nooo!"
"Yeah, okay."
"Yeah?"
"Yeah! All right! You go first."
"Okay, okay, I'll go first."
"Okay."
"So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies,and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing...."
"Princess Leia in the gold bikini."
"Yes!"
"I know!"
"Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go."
"Okay."
"Okay."
"Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
"Hmph."
"And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all theselike, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at theXerox place...."
"With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!"
"I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. Andyour like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can'tpossibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it'skinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!"
"Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is thematter with you?"
"You said..."
"I said '"
"We're baack!"
"Hey!"
"What are you guys doing together?"
"Joey and Janice's"
"Really."
"Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, Ilove this woman. You have got competition buddy."
"I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so.I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. (laughs)"
"You still can't stand her can you?"
"I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did."
"Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot."
"But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole daytogether and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at SheaStadium."
"Well, I guess that's something."
"No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which meansI get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway."
"Okay."
"Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran intoRoss."
"Oh God!"
"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too."
"Really?"
"Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex."

"Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?"
"Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would comeinto the city for a little Monicuddle. (hugs her) Since when did you start smoking cigars?"
"I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are youreally doing here Dad?"
"Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay."
"What makes you think that I might not be okay?"
"I saw Richard."
"Oh."
"So, how are you doing?"
"I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?"
"You don't wanna know."
"No, I really, really do."
"Well, he's doing terrible!"
"Really!"
"Worse than when he broke up with Barbara."
"You're not just saying that are you?"
"No, the man is a mess."
"Was he crying?"
"No."
"Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?"
"Maybe."
"I think so."
"Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You knowafter we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather,wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam'snickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, (turnsaround and sees that Monica is sleeping and puts a blanket around her, kisses her, picksup the cigar, and starts watching the video)"
"Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird lookon your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What?Did you just picture it differently? What? What?"
"No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Momstanding where Rachel is)"
