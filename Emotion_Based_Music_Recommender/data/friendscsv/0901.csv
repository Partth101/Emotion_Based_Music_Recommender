"Hey, where’s uh, where’s mom?"
"She went to pick up Aunt Liddy."
"Oh, Aunt Liddy’s coming? That means we get five dollars each!"
"So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this? (Pulls a bouquet offlowers out of his sleeve.)"
"Okay. Wow."
"Uh Dad, Emma’s in the nursery. I’ll take you now. If you want,but (To Rachel) I really want to talk to you."
"I know, I still need to talk to you."
"Oh hey but, before you guys do that (To Rachel) I need to talk to you, andRoss, I need to talk to you."
"(To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you."

"To see if know what these guys are talking about."
"Isn’t she beautiful?"
"Look at her, my first grandchild."
"What about Ben?"
"Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. (To Monica,mouths) Wow."

"Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all camein the room."
"Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow, you could’ve done that with usthere."
"Yeah right."
"Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’ttalk to Rachel."
"What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?"
"Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenianfamily was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still hasmy"
"(taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Sure."
"Dude I just did something terrible."
"That was you?! I thought it was Jack!"
"No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!"
"What?! Why does she think that?"
"Because it kinda looked like I did."
"Again, what?!"
"Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…"
"As we all are at some point during the day."
"It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when Iknelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!"
"Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?"
"I guess."
"And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much heloves to propose!"
"I know! I know it’s awful."
"Well, what did she say?"
"(happily) She said yes."
"Does Ross know?"
"Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?"
"Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything."
"Oh, I like that. Yeah…"
"If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out,but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!"
"(laughs) Now let’s not get carried away. (He walks away as Monicacomes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)"
"I want a baby."
"Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way."
"Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances ofgetting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?"
"I’m so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but noforeplay."
"Deal!"
"Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!"
"Noted."
"I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for abit?"
"Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever."
"(noticing something) Actually umm… (He turns Mr. Geller’s headto look at Emma.)"
"Hey!"
"Hi."
"Are you all right?"
"Uhh… I think I just got engaged."
"Oh my God! He did it?"
"Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?"
"Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like tothink of myself as the puppet master of the group."
"And you really think this is a good idea?"
"I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. Thepuppet master gets tired people."
"I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right."
"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so."
"Really?! Even Ross?"
"Especially Ross!"
"(entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’llcome back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross who’s entering.)"
"Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guessjust…I’ll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)"
"There he goes, your fiancée."
"I guess so."
"Although he does play with himself in his sleep."
"I can’t say that I’m surprised."
"Dad, what are you doing?"
"I think there are people in there having sex."
"It can’t be me, I’m standing right here."
"Wanna peek?"
"No!"
"Come on!"
"Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on.(Walks away.)"
"(To Ross) We’re not peeking? (Follows him.)"
"Well I’m peeking. (He peeks.) Oh my God!"
"Hello sir, you know Monica."
"Hey uh, is it okay to come in?"
"Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!"
"Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya."
"Hey!"
"Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?"
"Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my breast?"
"It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, butdon’t worry. It’ll happen."
"(watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)"
"Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth."
"Dear Lord."
"I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?"
"Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…"
"Oh look, she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are toobig for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn’t she lookscared?"
"Y’know, I don’t really know her."
"Why don’t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. (Doesso.)"
"(To God) Are you kidding me?!"
"It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!"
"I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy! (Storms out.)"
"Oh hey! Wait up!"
"Hi!"
"Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet."
"What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit,although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier."
"No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!"
"What?"
"Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secretthing in a long time."
"Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose."
"Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that youwere a doctor?"
"(pause) I"
"All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that she’ssleeping.) Should we wake her up?"
"No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted."
"And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)"
"What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-shethinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!"
"Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Rossdoctors are supposed to be smart."
"I didn’t give her that ring!"
"Really?"
"No!"
"So whose ring is it?"
"It’s mine."
"Is it an engagement ring?"
"Yes!"
"But you didn’t give it to her?"
"No!"
"But you were going to propose?"
"No!!"
"Huh, I might be losing interest in this."
"Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose toRachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wantedah…start…things up again."
"Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment."
"Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like shedidn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of thishappened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose,throw it on, and-and just start telling people?"
"No! No, she said you actually proposed to her."
"Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose! (Pause) Unless uh… (Pause)Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I woulddo."
"Look, we can’t stay in here forever."
"Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’tmake it to"
"This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to beashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (Theydo so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)"
"Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?"
"Of course. I’ll always be your dad."
"I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, thatwasn’t for fun."
"It wasn’t fun?!"
"(To Monica) Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why… (To Mr. Geller)Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever wewant."
"Oh, I don’t think that. Before today I never thought of you twohaving sex at all. It was a simpler time."
"The truth is, Dad, we’re-we’re trying."
"What?"
"Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant."
"Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! (Points tothe closet) I’ll guard the door!"
"Well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later."
"Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t think so! Aren’t you ovulating?"
"Daddy?!"
"Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I weretrying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That’s how I gotmy bad hip."
"That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet holein my head."
"This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, shewas…"
"Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positionsyou and mom had sex."
"You’re right, you’re right. This is about your positions.Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, althoughit might feel good."
"I don’t feel good right now."
"But pleasure is important, (To Chandler) and it helps if the womanhas an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?"
"Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall."
"Hey."
"Hey. I need to tell you something."
"Well, now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cutoff."
"Joey asked me marry him."
"What?"
"Joey proposed to me."
"Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!"
"Well, I-I said yes."
"What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross’s baby! It’s-it’sso inappropriate. No, it’s worse than that. It’s wrong. It’s… It isbigger than mine! (Rachel’s engagement ring.)"
"I know."
"You can’t marry him!"
"Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweetguy and he loves me so much."
"Well do you love him?"
"Sure."
"Sure?"
"Yeah, I mean whatever."
"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?"
"No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?"
"You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?"
"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took herbreast out."
"Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it looklike?!"
"I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it."
"Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out."
"Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. Idon’t want to hurt her."
"Okay, look, just do it gently."
"You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now beforeRoss finds out and I’ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by theway. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) ifyou want to check that out."
"Hey."
"Hey."
"Listen, I um… I heard about the engagement."
"Surprised?"
"And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um…I didn’t propose to you."
"I know."
"I don’t think you do."
"You didn’t propose to me. Joey did."
"Poor baby, you’re so tired. Rach, I didn’t propose to you, Joeydidn’t propose to you, and Chandler didn’t propose to you."
"Uh… You didn’t propose to me, Chandler didn’t propose tome, but Joey did."
"Joey proposed to you?"
"I can come back."
"Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?"
"No."
"Yes you did!"
"Actually, technically, I didn’t."
"Well then why did you give me a ring?"
"Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?"
"No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!"
"Yes, you did!"
"No, I didn’t!"
"Yes, you did!"
"No, I didn’t!"
"Yes, you did! And don’t you say, "No, I didn’t!""
"Ahhh!"
"He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed."
"Whoa! You were down on one knee?"
"Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn’t…I didn’t propose!"
"Then what did happen?"
"Yeah, what did happen?"
"Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and youthought I was proposing."
"Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?""
"No, I didn’t!"
"Yes, you did!"
"No, I didn’t!"
"Yes, you did—Oh my God you didn’t! (Screams) Well then whydidn’t you tell me that before?!"
"Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!"
"Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!"
"(To Ross) I’ll tell you about it later. Be cool."
"Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!"
"It wasn’t my ring! It’s Ross’s ring! That’s why I feltso bad Rach, because he was going to propose."
"What?!"
"You were gonna propose to me?"
"Uhh… No."
"Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}"
"But I-I was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating againbut that—I mean that-that was all, Rach."
"Dude, step up! I proposed."
"No, you didn’t!"
"Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here and I think I atesome bad fruit earlier."
"Hey, she just woke up! She’s hungry. Why don’t we give thisanother try?"
"Okay."
"(To Joey) I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!"
"I can’t believe you’re not going to propose!"
"Hey, I’m not going to rush into anything!"
"Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with awoman I like to slow things down!"
"Oh my God!"
"What?"
"She’s doing it Look, she’s breast-feeding look!"
"(looking at the ceiling) Ah, it’s beautiful."
"I’ll come back for her later."
"Okay."
"Thank you. (The nurse exits.)"
"Oh wow, this feels weird."
"Good weird?"
"Wonderful weird."
"Y’know what you guys? I’m uh, I’m gonna go too. And uh,I’m sorry about everything."
"Honey don’t worry, it was my mistake."
"No, Rach, I should’ve told you sooner. It’s just that…Man!That kid is going to town! (Joey makes his awkward exit.)"
"She’s perfect."
"We’re so lucky."
"We really are."
"Look, I-I know it’s not a proposal and I don’t know where youare, but with everything that’s been going on and with Emma and…I’ve beenfeeling…"
"I know. I know. I’ve feeling…"
"Yeah?"
"Yeah. (Laughs nervously)"
"Okay, well, that… Wow, okay, well, umm…then maybe, at least wecan, we can talk about us again."
"Yeah, maybe."
"Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y’know if we…if…You’re wearing the ring."
"Wh-what’s that?"
"And you told Phoebe you were engaged."
"I’m sorry, what?"
"When you thought Joey proposed did…did you say yes?"
"Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to getpregnant. (He slides them under the door.)"
"(walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!"
"Hey."
"(pause) Sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphletsback? (They do so.) Thank you."
