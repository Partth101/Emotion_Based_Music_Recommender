"Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I meany’know you can’t date him right?"
"Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spendso much time together he should call me his work wife."
"Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired."
"I am not gonna get fired, because I’m not gonna act on it."
"So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else?"
"Why? Is he? He is! Isn’t he? He’s dating that slut inmarketing!"
"Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club."
"Dude that is so sad."

"Could I play?"
"Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?"
"I just did them."
"Oh, well drop and give me ten more!"

"Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight."
"Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?"
"Well, we’ve been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping thattonight it would turn into something a little more than that."
"Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain’t a locker room, okay?But, y’know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight."
"Oh no!"

"Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?"
"Nothing, why?"
"How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I’ll pay."
"Huh, Rach I got to say it’s gonna take a lot of money for me to goout on a date with a dude."
"I’m not asking you to go on a"
"Really? ‘Cause I could kinda use the money."

"Yeah, okay."
"Yeah?"
"Sure, no problem. (Sees something.) Ooh—Hey, donuts!"
"Yeah!"
"Okay. (He grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and guess what he spills allover himself. He tries to clean it up and smears it all over the shirt.)"
"I know. Let’s try a look…of far off…wonderment. Okay,we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and thedays to come. (Chandler is still not getting it.) Chandler!

"You see? Nothing is good enough for her!"
"Good morning."
"Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?"
"Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game."

"Yeah! That guy’s all right!"
"Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey."
"What?"
"Y’know, all the women."
"Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know,that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler."
"(Pause) I’m right here!"
"All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay,just the idea of you and he and all these women, it’s just—And I know he’smy assistant and I can’t date him—but it just bothers me, all right?!"
"Hey! No-no-no-no, you can’t take him away from me! I got a greatpartner to pick up girls with! Finally!!"
"I’m still right here!"
"All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow andunsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!"
"(shocked) What?!"

"Both of you together?"
"Wh-what’s up?"
"Well, I went over to Kyle’s last night to pick up a few things andwe got to reminiscing…"

"Oh just say it Kyle!"
"We’re gonna give it another try."
"What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!"
"I’m gonna work on that."
"Oh right, because you’re so capable of change."
