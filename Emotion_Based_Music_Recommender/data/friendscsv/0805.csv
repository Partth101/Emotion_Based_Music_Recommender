"All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad."

"Hey Toby! Have a good night. (Walks by.)"
"Did that guy just call you Toby?"
"Yeah, he thinks that’s my name."
"Well, why don’t you correct him?"
"Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean thefirst time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t sayanything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" AndI-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’mstill Toby."
"Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!"
"No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in differentdepartments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in awhile. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s callingme Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)"
"(laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizessomething.) Oh my God! Chandler"
"Shh! It is a family name!"
"Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?"
"Drake, I’ve discovered the reason for all your headachesand memory loss."
"What is it?"
"Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. Itseems your body is rejecting Jessica’s brain."
"Is it serious?"
"Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesizeantibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting thebrain."
"Well that sounds simple enough, let’s just do that."
"We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica’s body, it wasgone."
"Cut! Very nice people!"
"(To Rachel) Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner."
"Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?!"
"I’m not telling, you’ll have to see it on TV!"
"You don’t know do you?"
"No, couldn’t care less."
"Hey good scene man."
"Hey you too!"
"Alright."
"What? You weren’t in it."
"Oh! (Motions to Joey’s co-star.)"
"Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?"
"Yes?"
"This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel."
"Hi."
"Hey! How come I haven’t seen you here before?"
"Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, hethinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not.Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (Startsstroking his arm) And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that,I’m just stroking your arm."
"(grabbing her) Here we go! Here we go! (Starts to pull her away fromKash.)"
"Oh, we’re leaving. Bye Kash."
"Bye."
"Say hi to Wally."
"Ooh Monica!"
"Hi!"
"Oh my God! I had the"
"I…I have to fire him."
"But why?!"
"Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, lastnight he lit my pastry chef on fire!"
"Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be veryintimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be takendown a peg or two."
"Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished."
"But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him anotherchance? Please?"
"(thinks about it) All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire heis out of there!"
"That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when hegot the pastry chef he got you a little bit too."
"I paid to have this done."
"Love it!"
"Hey!"
"Hi!"
"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thoughtyou were charming."
"I thought I was a complete idiot."
"Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go outwith him."
"Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?"
"I said no."
"What?!"
"What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re notgonna be seeing people."
"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what didhe say when you told him I was pregnant?"
"I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people.This is back when I thought Kash was still people."
"Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him callme okay?"
"Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great…"
"Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet moreactors! I’ll meet ‘em all!"
"Hey Bob."
"Hey! How’s my pal Toby doing today?"
"If I see him, I’ll ask."
"(laughs) Toby!"
"Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?"
"Yeah!"
"Oh then you know each other."
"We’re on a semi-first name basis."
"What do you think of adding him to our team?"
"Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know ifhe has what it takes."
"Really? They love him down on six."
"But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here."
"Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put."
"I think it’s best sir."
"But we really do need to find someone up here. The work isstarting to pile up. I’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high. (Holds hishand at shoulder level.)"
"Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder andclaim you never got ‘em."
"(laughs) That’s a good one. (Walks away.)"
"What does a guy have to"
"Hey!"
"Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has"
"But…"
"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommendedhim to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!""
"Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today."
"Why not?!"
"Because I’m dumping him today."
"What?! You said he was sweet!"
"He"
"Just don’t pick up your phone."
"Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) "I’m so worried aboutyou." Uck! Be a man!"
"What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?"
"You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll killhimself."
"Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him foranother week."
"Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill"
"Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have todeal with it!"
"Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoevergoes second is the bitch."
"What do you mean?"
"Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch!And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!"
"I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first."
"All right, that makes sense. (Starts towards the door.) Ugh.But—Screw you I’m going first! (She grabs her purse and runs out.)"
"Hey Toby, you got a sec?"
"Sure, what’s up?"
"I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, butI just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I’m not eleventhfloor material. Say uh, who the"
"Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinkingon this date tonight. "Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon,"or "I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?""
"(entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!"
"Hi!"
"Hey!"
"So, what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at theAngelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?"
"No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya."
"Rach? You wanna come?"
"Oh no, I can’t. I got a date."
"A date?"
"Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?"
"Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular.It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull."
"It’s no Ukrainian film."
"Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! (Goes into her room.)"
"A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?"
"I set her up with this actor on my show."
"You set her up?!"
"No"
"Joey what-what were you thinking?!"
"Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Rosshasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!"
"Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby!Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actortaking them?"
"Hey! I’m an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! I’mnot sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on StatenIsland."
"A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerousthose are?!"
"Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go likefive miles an hour?"
"Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’sa fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!"
"Hey Joey."
"Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash."
"Hey."
"Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight."
"Yeah."
"A bit of a daredevil are we?"
"(entering from her room) Hey guys do you think this is tooslutty—Hi Kash!"
"Hey Rachel! You ready to go?"
"Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later."
"Okay. Have a great time you guys."
"Thank you."
"Thank you."
"Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear theentire sentence.)"
"(walks behind Phoebe) Hi! (And startles her.)"
"Hi."
"Oh, I’m so glad you called. I feel like it’s always me callingyou. So, what’s up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?"
"It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy."
"It’s because I’m with you."
"Aw. (Phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) I’mjust—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I…"
"Whoops. Sorry. (Looking at it, like a newscaster) This just in. (Phoebefake laughs.) Oh, it’s 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me rightaway. (Starts to leave.)"
"Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay."
"Awww, I’ll miss you too Pheebs. (Starts to leave) And I will beholding you, right here. (Holds his hands over his heart, blows a kiss to Phoebe whocatches it, and then leaves and Phoebe throws the kiss back.)"
"So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read.Okay? I get enough of that from books."
"Books?"
"All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like"
"Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stayhere? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang."
"And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?"
"Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no."
"Dude! What is going on?!"
"I just…I have to find out how it went."
"Why?"
"This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!"
"They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?!He’s not you!"
"I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!"
"Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?"
"I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this ishappening."
"What do you mean?"
"It’s just I always thought when I had"
"That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!"
"No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby wentwith her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away."
"Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and yourwife, is your wife Rachel?"
"It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ bodythough."
"Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel."
"No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?"
"I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants."
"No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myselfto fall in love with her again now."
"That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s notgonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new littlebaby,"

"Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the jobup here."

"Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well?"
"Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want."
"Oh?"
"He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hearthose hemorrhoids are a bitch.""
