"Man, this is bad! And I’ve had my share of bad reviews. I stillremember my first good one though. (Quoting) "Everything else in this production of"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey."
"(seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers!It must be a good review! Is it great?!"
"Umm…"
"(reading) Oh dear God!"
"But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know."
"What about the rest of Manhattan?!"
"Yeah, they all know."
"Oh my God, this is horrible!"
"I’m so sorry."
"I’m so humiliated!"
"Yeah but y’know what they say Mon, "There’s no such thingas bad press.""

"That is seven days!"
"Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do thisafter…"

"It’s funny you should mention diapers."

"(annoyed) Yeah!"
"Umm, our situation. Y’know umm, what we mean to each other. And Imean we-we’re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn’t that,isn’t that weird?"

"I’m just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.)"
"(entering) Hey uh Monica, I can’t remember. Did we say we were gonnameet here or at the movies?"
"We said at the movies, but…"
"Okay, I’ll see you there. (Starts to leave)"
"Joey! (He returns) Now that you’re here…"
"Sure, I can hang out ‘til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) Whatuh—How come you’re not going?"
"I have a job interview I have to get ready for."
"I thought you already have a job."
"And people say you don’t pay attention. No, this is a much betterjob. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statisticalfactoring for other companies."
"Wow! How do you know how to do that?!"
"That’s what I do now."
"Hey Joey, come taste this."
"What is it?"
"Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well… (Feeds him aspoonful of what she’s cooking.) I’m getting my revenge!"
"You cooked him?"
"No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so beforewe go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, Icannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! "Restaurant reviewer admits:I was wrong about Monica.""
"The front page? You really do live in your own little world,don’t ya?"
"Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?"
"Oh."
"Oh."
"No-no-no! No, no, no, we’re not married."
"We are having a baby together, but we’re not involved. (The cashier,a very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a whileago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks athim angrily) Or, yes stranger, we’d like this delivered please."
"Why don’t you fill out this address card. (Hands him one.)"
"Oh, okay."
"I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items."
"Oh yeah! Actually, that’s one of the reasons why we’re not acouple."
"I chose those, I’m a paleontologist."
"Really?! That is so cool!"
"Oh. Oh yeah, don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it soundslike he’s a doctor, but he’s not."
"Oh no-no, I’m fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the newWalter Alvarez book?"
"Yeah! I-I teach it in my class."
"Oh my God! I’m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card,and I’m bored."
"(looking at the completed address card) Oh, I love your neighborhood.There’s a great gym right around the corner from your building."
"That’s my gym."
"I can tell you work out. (Ross is please and Rachel looks at himconfused.) A paleontologist who works out, you’re like Indiana Jones. (Rachel has adisbelieving look on her face.)"
"I"
"Hi Pheebs!"
"Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?"
"Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almostgot something that wasn’t on the list. A whore."
"What?!"
"Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just startedflirting with him."
"Well did she know you two weren’t married?"
"Yeah."
"Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man,we-we must alert the church elders!"
"You don’t understand! You didn’t see how brazen she was."
"Sounds like you’re a little jealous."
"No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’sthat I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl atSluts ‘R’ Us!"
"Is that a real place? (Rachel’s stunned) Are they hiring?"
"(entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!"
"Hey Chandler, why so fancy?"
"Well, I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lotmore money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring."
"Wait, I think I know someone who does that."
"Me! I do that. So… Seriously, do I look okay? I’m littlenervous."
"Oh yeah! You really—You look great."
"Yeah, just don’t get your hopes up."
"Why not?"
"Well, the interview…"
"What about it?"
"Y’know! You don’t make a very good first impression."
"(shocked) What?!"
"Oh you don’t know."
"Are you serious?!"
"Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah."I was like, shhh!"
"What is it that I do?"
"Well it’s just like you’re trying too hard. Always makingjokes, y’know, you just—You come off a little needy."
"(To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?"
"Chandler, I’m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away fromyou. (Gets up and hurries out.)"
"Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s."
"Still?"
"I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I wouldlike for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance."
"I don’t see any reason why I would do that to myselfagain."
"Either eat it, or be in it."
"Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?"
"I’m torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid abeating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. (Throws down the spoon and walksout.)"
"Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there’s a new classcomin’ in."
"Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start,can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce? (Noone can.)"
"I can."
"Okay, go ahead."
"Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise hasshallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon."
"That’s very good, what’s your name?"
"Monica."
"Monica, you go to the head of the class."
"Okay. (Does so.)"
"All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are youabout keeping Ben in your life?"
"My son? Pretty serious. (There’s a knock on the door and Ross answersit.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?"
"Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. (Ablanket.)"
"Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left inyour store."
"Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my jobdescription."
"Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the livingroom and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)"
"Oh uh…I actually came here to ask you out."
"Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this (Themoney) back in my pocket, pretend"
"Sure!"
"Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaursshe’s holding are arguing.) No! You’re a horny bitch! Noooo! You’re thehorny bitch! No! You’re a horny bitch!"
"So you guys go, have a really good time."
"(To Katie) Yeah, I’m just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip.(Katie looks worried.) Y’know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-notbecause I’m-I’m into S&M. (Katie’s worried again.) I’mnot-I’m not into anything weird. Y’know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie isuncomfortable.) So, I’m gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachelalone.)"
"So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy."
"Are you okay with this?"
"Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun."
"Okay. It was nice to see you."
"Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although youmissed a button."
"Oh umm, actually I umm…"
"Oh okay, I see what you’re doing there."
"I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?"
"Oh! It’s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can seehow really sweet and wonderful you really are."
"Oh good. Good, because I’m sure this interview is gonna last acouple of weeks."
"All right, don’t"
"An hour."
"I can’t help you."
"Phoebe!"
"All right, all right, we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’ssay I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi!Come on in, I’m uh, Regina Philange.""
"Chandler Bing."
"Bing, what an unusual name."
"Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) I’ll let myself out."
"Hi."
"Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use allyour cheese?"
"When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?"
"And the cream?"
"Cheese makes me thirsty."
"Okay. Let’s move on."
"All right."
"(To Monica) Oh! Something smells good over at Monica’sstation! (She tries Monica’s fettuccini.) Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing!You’ve never made this before?"
"Oh no! I don’t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someonewhat it’s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles."
"Well, hats off to the chef."
"I-I-I’m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn’t hear whatyou said. Umm, hats off to who now?"
"The chef!"
"That’s right."
"…I think you’ll find if I come to work here, I don’tmicro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating."
"Um-hmm, that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on whatyou don’t do, and start focusing on what you do do."
"(suppressing a smile) What I do do…is manage to uh, create anatmosphere of support for the people working with me."
"I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way."
"Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life."
"You gotta go!"
"Oh! (Stands up.)"
"Okay, don’t worry. You’re ready."
"Really?"
"Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll begreat."
"Okay."
"Ah Monica, my star student."
"Y’know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty offashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give methe star. (Hands it to her.)"
"(tasting the cookie and with her mouthful) Oh, yum-yum-yum.(Hands the star back.)"
"Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-andI’m sorry, but I don’t care."
"Okay Joey, you’re up next. (Tries one of his cookies.)This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!"
"I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, I’m a dork."
"Joey! I’m so proud of you!"
"I think you should give him your star."
"Excuse me? He doesn’t even know what he’s doing!"
"We’re all beginners here. Nobody knows whatthey’re doing."
"I do! I’m a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax!It’s not a courtroom drama!"
"If you’re a professional chef, what are you doingtaking Introduction to Cooking?"
"Yeah!"
"I’m-I’m sorry, it’s just that umm… Well I-I cook atthis restaurant, Alessandro’s, and umm I just got a really bad review…"
"Oh Alessandro’s! I"
"You do?"
"Oh yes! You’re an excellent chef! As a personyou’re a little…"
"Oh, I’m totally crazy, but you-you like the food?"
"Very much."
"Okay then, I don’t stink. I’m a good chef. Okay. (Starts toleave.)"
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t want to go. I’m having fun."
"Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?"
"Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it’s time to go, it’s time to go.(Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)"
"…also I was the point person on my company’s transition fromthe KL-5 to GR-6 system."
"You must’ve had your hands full."
"That I did. That I did."
"So let’s talk a little bit about your duties."
"(nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right."
"Now you’ll be heading a whole division, so you’llhave a lot of duties."
"(trying not to laugh) I see."
"But there’ll be perhaps 30 people under you so you candump a certain amount on them."
"(really try not to laugh) Good to know."
"We can go into detail…"
"No don’t I beg of you!"
"All right then, we’ll have a definite answer for you onMonday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you’ll fit in well here."
"(relieved) Really?!"
"Absolutely. (They walk to the door.) You can relax; you didgreat."
"Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y’knowI’ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hardto sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn’t understand) Duties. (Stilldoesn’t.) Duties! (Still doesn’t.) Poo. (Still doesn’t.)"
"Poo?"
"Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, thatwas the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Callsecurity! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!"
"Poo?!"
"I’ll look forward to your call. (Walks away.)"
"Hey."
"Hi! You’re back from your date!"
"How are you?"
"I’m fine, but that’s not important. What’s important ishow was she?"
"Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee."
"Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table."
"What’s uh, what’s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?"
"No! No, she’s—She was nice. I mean, she’s a littleslutty, but who isn’t?"
"I liked her."
"Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called youIndiana Jones!"
"Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!"
"No! It’s just that, Kate bothered me."
"Why? What was wrong with her?"
"There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!"
"Okay, so what’s the matter?"
"I don’t want you to date her!"
"(laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?"
"Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because Idon’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing toeven think this, and it’s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at myconstant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry, but that is just the way thatI feel."
"Okay."
"What?!"
"I won’t date. I’ll uh, I’ll be here, with you, all thetime."
"Really? But I’m being so unreasonable."
"True, but you’re allowed to be unreasonable. You’re having ourbaby."
"(starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)"
"Do you feel better?"
"No, not really. You’re pressing the baby into my bladder and now Ihave to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)"
"Uh Rach?"
"Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)"
"Just one thing umm…"
"Uh-huh."
"We live together. You’re having our baby. I’m not gonna seeanybody else. Are you-are you sure you don’t want something more?"
"(pause) Wow! I don’t know, maybe. I’m…"
"Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin’ around! (She’s stunned) Like youdid last night when I had to pee?"
"(laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin’ with you too!"
"(pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you…"
"Oh no-no-no-no, no!"
"…that you actually…"
"No that’s just—(Laughs)—That’s just ‘causeI’m such a good messer!"
"Rach?"
"Yeah?"
"The bathroom?"
"Right! (Heads for the bathroom.)"
"Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that’sthe first A I’ve gotten since seventh grade,"
"Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?"
"What the hell!"
"Okay."
"All right, let’s start with some basics. Can anybodytell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?"
"Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.)"
