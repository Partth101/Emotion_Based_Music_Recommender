"(even more abashed) A place to eat spaghetti."
"Very good! (Gives him the keys) What do you need itfor anyway?"
"Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million andthey don't sell tickets here in New York, so..."

"(hesitates for a moment)Yeah Connecticut...Not WestVirginia."
"Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buysome tickets myself!"
"Uh!"
"Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could reallyuse 300 million dollars."
"Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300million? No thank you!"
"Hey will you get me tickets too?"
"Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we allpitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win,we'll split it!"
"yeah thats a greatidea!"
"No thanks!"
"You don't wanna win the lottery?"
"(in a  mocking voice)Uh...sure I do, and I also wannabe King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart."
"Still on Amelia Earhart?"
"The woman just vanished!"
"Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?"
"No! Do you know what your odds are of winning thelottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck bylightning 42 times."
"Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to getstruck by lightning 7 times."
"I like those odds!"
"Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going tospend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki."
"(looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross)Boohaki?"
"Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we'retrying to be careful about what words we use in front of her."
"Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki,goshdarnit and brotherpucker."
"How do you know she's gonna start talking?"
"Well when I talk to her I almost feel like sheunderstands what I'm saying."
"Kinda like Joey."
"(who wasn't paying attention)What's that now?"
"God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! Youknow I haven't won anything since the sixth grade."
"Pie eating contest?"
"Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only wayI could win something?"
"No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries."
"(smiling)That was a good day!"
"(yelling to Monica)They're towing your car, they'retowing your car!!"
"I'm parked in a garage on Morton!"
"(panting)They're towing"
"(sounding panicky)Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma!And Rachel you don't have Emma! (Starts yelling) Where's Emma? Who hasEmma!?"
"Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. Youwere there!"
"(not yelling anymore)I was?"
"Yes and you talked to her..."
"I did?"
"She dropped off a casserole?"
"Oh yeah! The casserole lady."
"(to Ross)So, did you come by to watch us win the bigbucks?"
"Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we couldall go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancingon top of it!"
"(hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'llget it, I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)"
"(to Monica)Think he washed his hands?"
"(into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?"
"(to Monica)What's going on?"
"Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting anassistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they areonly hiring three."
"Ooh! Tough odds!"
"(mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your24 state lottery!"
"(smiling)Look who's coming around!"
"(still on the phone)Damnit. Alright call me whenyou know more."
"(excited)Did you get it?"
"One of the slots got filled."
"(Still excited)By you!?"
"Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it."
"Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up yourpants!"
"Yeah I know."
"Well, there's two spots left right?"
"Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wannaget one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't careabout Charlie."
"(excited)Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going tobelieve this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonnawin the lottery tonight!"
"Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extraluck so I brought a wishbone home from work."
"(mockingly)A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someoneelse a chance!"
"Alright, who wants to do it?"
"Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat themeat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!"
"Ok, hey Rach?"
"Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smellall over my hands."
"I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine."
"I hope I win!"
"Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishingfor the same thing, right?"
"I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...youknow...won't come true!"
"Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!"
"Can't really say!"
"I understand, but you're wishing for what we thinkyou're wishing for, aren't you?"
"(slightly irritated)I'm not really comfortable withthese questions!"
"Please, just do it!"
"One, two, three!"
"I won, hey!"
"You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true,but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rubthis lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) Ah!! That thinggets hot!!"
"You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How areyou gonna feel if we actually do win?"
"Uh, you're not gonna win."
"Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, butsomebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel?You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take ourhelicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can'tguys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai""
"Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing likethat."
"I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friendfilled with regret eats own arm"."
"Why would I eat my own arm?"
"Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we canprint whatever we want."
"You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks foryou."
"Why?"
"Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki"but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you'remy brother, and I want you to be a part of this."
"You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But justthe fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet!Come here (they kiss and hug)"
"Get a room!"
"Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do ifwe win?"
"I don't know, probably just invest it."
"Ooh! Calm down ..."
"Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cooland piss it all away" (Joey and Chandler pleased)"
"Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buythe Knicks!"
"I don't really care about the Knicks."
"Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward."
"(touched) You would do that? I never get picked!"
"You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way togo."
"You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believeyou're taking this away from me!"
"You're right, it has been you dream for over 15seconds."
"(to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce thenumbers, Mommy?"
"(looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh... Mommy?"
"Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy"when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ..."
"I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be herfirst word."
"Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably callme "Daddy" too."
"Oooh, I like that, "daddy" (in a sexy tone)"
"I ... I was just talking about Rachel."
"(still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Isdaddy gonna spank me?"
"(tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have youbeen a baaad gi .. (stops) no I can't."
"Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody elsehear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept withhim!! .. Alright, bye. (hangs up)"
"Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?"
"Well no, Charlie's gonna get that."
"Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance asanybody else of getting that job!"
"He's the boss's son."
"Come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)"
"Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes."
"Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets asquickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideashow to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) Ok, how about this: wedivide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read bywhoever finishes their pile first."
"Ooh, I have another idea!"
"I'm sorry, idea time is over."
"Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?"
"Yeah."
"What about the ones you have on the nightstand?"
"There are no tickets on the nightstand!"
"Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago."
"Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!"
"Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!"
"Chandler, sense the tone!!"
"Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!"
"Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me andChandler."
"Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed."
"I can't believe this, I thought we were all in thistogether!"
"Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!"
"3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ..."
"I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut,when did you even get those?"
"When you were reading the dirty magazines withouttaking off the plastic!"
"(to Ross) I'll show you how."
"Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" ticketswin? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose allyour friends?"
"Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are notgonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week andI couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!"
"Chandler, would you just tell her what she did waswrong?"
"(to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have boughttickets just for us ..."
"Ahhh!  (shocked)"
"Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, itdoesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to haveprinciples, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets fromRachel)"
"There's the man I married!!"
"All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it'sthe last you're gonna hear from us!"
"Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends!Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look justlike you!"
"(surprised) OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! Iwant my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!"
"Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl fromRachel)! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!"
"Than I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! Andif I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond."
"Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the ticketstogether (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)"
"No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl)and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!"
"Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me!This all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)"
"Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!"
"Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split themup! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, soshe pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)"
"(in pain) Oh!"
"(she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and shestarts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!"
"(trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!"
"(keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (shestops) Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (shegoes out to the balcony)"
"Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets."
"No, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they getjammed in the window)"
"If we are not doing it together, we're not doing itat all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, andmakes as to drop the tickets on the street)."
"NO!!"
"Don't come any closer!"
"Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things aregetting squished..."
"No, what's more important, your friends or money?"
"Friends!"
"Money! (they all look at her) Friends..."
"Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?"
"They're all in there! Even these five that I hid inmy bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)..."
"Monica!"
"Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There wasno way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring Phoebewho drops the bowl on the street) Oh God, no! (pause) I think I brokeyour bowl."
"Go, go, go!!"
"What a beautiful night to be running around thestreet, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun."
"Phoebe, we lost half of them."
"So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! Mypsychic said I  was gonna win, remember?"
"Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about thescary pigeon..."
"As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going todie. (pause ) So, excuse me for being a little skittish."
"(looking at the answering machine) Hey, there's twomessages. These could be from work!"
"Oh, play them!"
"Ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)"
"(Phoebe's voice) "Hello. Th-this is the pigeon fromthe balcony calling to apologise" (they all turns to look at Phoebe) "Ish.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady'shand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo.""
"Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do."
""Hey Chandler, it's Charlie""
"This is..shhh!"
""Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot.I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me acall if you want.""
"Oh God, I am so sorry honey..."
"Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!"
"Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time theypromoted Sandra over me at work."
"Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?"
"No, she was just much better at job than me!"
"Guys, the drawing is about to start!"
"(To Ross) You know what? We should call my mum'shouse and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down."
"Oh yeah, it's a good idea!"
"(she hugs Chandler) Honey, you've been really strongabout this, I know how badly you wanted that job."
"Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.(pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130chances to win, right?"
"(she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants)131! (they kiss)"
"(on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. Andremember, you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to Rachel)Phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver toRachel)"
"Hi mum, put her back on!"
"(sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) Rach, come on!They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myselfchanging."
""Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53""
"I got that!"
"Oh, we have one too!!"
"We are on a roll, people!!"
"(calling Rachel) Come on!!"
"(on the phone) Mum, please!I know you love your newlips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let mesay goodnight to my daughter?"
""And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7""
"Check your numbers! Make me rich!"
"(she goes towards the others and she's very excited)Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight toEmma and she said her first words!!"
"Wow!"
"And what did she say?"
"She said "gleba"!! (she celebrates)"
"Make me rich!!"
"(to Ross) Isn't that amazing?"
"Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!"
"Why-why aren't you more excited?"
"Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word."
"Oh, but of course it is!"
"Okay, what does it mean?"
"I don't know all the words."
"I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter'sfirst words (goes back to checking the tickets)."
"Yes you did, gleba is a word!"
"Ok, use it in a sentence."
"Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!"
"It's not a word!"
"Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up (she goesand picks up the dictionary)."
"Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it shesaid another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up:pbbqqt...."
"(searching the dictionary) Alright, okay, okay, gleba,gleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearinginner mass of a certain fungi."
"She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head,very moved)"
"(checking the last ticket) Damnit! anybody got anything?"
"No."
"I'm still looking through mine..."
"Just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) No!"
"(answering phone) Hello? Hold on. It's your boss."
"Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'mnot used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from thesofa) Hey, Steve."
"Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the threepositions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, youwouldn't be happy being someone's assistant."
"Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant!Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm nottoo mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!"
"Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program.We're offering you the position of junior copywriter."
"Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?"
"Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level ofsophistication you'll be bringing to the job."
"Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see youtomorrow (hangs up)."
"What? (pause) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a juniorcopywriter."
"(excited) Oh my God, congratulations!"
"Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!"
"Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?"
"You bet! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofaand goes to the kitchen area)"
"(to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job."
"Thanks, man."
"And I like to think I had a little something to do withit."
"Really? What?"
"Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish wewould win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job."
"(smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards thekitchen, worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heartright out."
"Oh yeah."
"You know what? There is a little part of me thatreally thought we were gonna win."
"Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart themepark."
"You guys, what was the Powerball number again?"
"Seven."
"We won."
"What?"
"We won!"
"Let me see!"
"Don't tear it."
"Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers."
"I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number,we've won 3 dollars!"
"Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years orgo for the big payout."
"(still very excited) I don't care, I've never wonanything before, I can't believe this!"
"So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?"
"It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents."
"You know what? You can have mine."
"Me too."
"Me too."
"Me too."
"I guess if everybody else is..."
"(sitting in a chair) Hey guys, so I just called thePowerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won."
"I beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and herplate of cookies)."
"Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guyin here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside,and won $10,000 (goes to the counter)."
"(hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the"pigeon voice" from before) Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. Itwas not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) Seriously, stopstaring at her."
