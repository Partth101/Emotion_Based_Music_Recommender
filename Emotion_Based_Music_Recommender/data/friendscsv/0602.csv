"Noooooooo!!"
"Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?"
"Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?"
"No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict."
"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?"
"No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, "Joey, I havetoo…" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "…go to thebathroom." He may think I’m sick."
"Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have toget it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them.Okay? That’s it."

"No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, here’sthe thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be movingout man."

"Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!"
"Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses,and turns back.) Like you’d believe that. This sucks!"
"Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promiseyou, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!"

"Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could youplease try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?(Exits.)"
"Bye."
"Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what couldthat be?!"
"Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is anembarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!"
"Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced threetimes, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates…"
"(interrupting) No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of thedating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy,and-and, Geologists."
"Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart andsweet and that is"
"Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?"
"Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who havebeen divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-thisembarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here."
"What?! Why?"
"(to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorcedfor the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?"
"And if you wait right here, I’ll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his armand prevents him from escaping.)"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!"
"(looking down) What gave me away?"
"I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe andshe’s the only one left!"
"Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official,we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?"
"No."
"Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave."
"Hey!"
"Hey."
"Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progressat work and then your boss calls you Raquel."
"Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called meSha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously."
"I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so ofcourse no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the endof the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!"
"Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…"
"What?"
"(To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)"
"Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and Iare going to live together, here."
"Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys!"
"Really?!"
"And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us aregonna have such a good time living together!"
"Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correcther.)"
"And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers youtake in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late."
"Rach…"
"Yeah, he’s gonna work on that."
"Ohh! This is"
"(singing)"
"…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage,wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at thealtar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to getmarried when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’sfault."
"Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Whowouldn’t want to date him?"
"Well the divorces don’t bother me, I’d date him. But, notwhile he’s still married."
"Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldn’t you want a date?"
"Actually, I’m dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I wasonly dating guys that were like y’know bad for me, so until I work that out…"
"(interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?"
"Well, I don’t care about the divorces either, but I wouldn’t datehim. It’s just that he’s"
"What?!"
"(leaning to him) She said, "He’s obviously still in love withthis Rachel girl." (He glares at her.)"
"This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have lovedher in the past, but"
"Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her."
"We were drunk! I would’ve married uh,"
"Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!"
"(to the panel) Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I"
"Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he"
"(getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget aboutthe whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right nowand get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth—(leansdown to Meg’s ear)—Nothing!!"
"Okay now I wouldn’t date you because you seem a little creepy."
"I am"
"Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?"
"Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! Icouldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!"
"Well, Joey’s my best friend."
"I’m not your best friend?"
"You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would youplease tell Rachel though?"
"All right, all right, at least I’m prepared."
"Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reachesfor one.)"
"(slapping his hand) Hey!"
"Hey-hey!"
"These aren’t for you! Are you upset?"
"I am now!"
"(entering) Hey roomie!"
"Okay, bye! (Exits.)"
"Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you."
"(gasps) Are you pregnant?!"
"No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a littlemisunderstanding before."
"Um-hmm."
"Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, livetogether we meant"
"(laughs) Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I didthat."
"Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’mreally sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’sabsolutely no rush."
"Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)"
"Okay. Don’t you want a cookie?"
"Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks."
"Maybe, do you need a tissue?"
"Monica, where did you get these?!"
"I made them!"
"Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy! (She re-ingests the previouslyexpelled cookie matter from the tissue.)"
"God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re nothere. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. "You wannago over to Joey and Chandler’s?" "Can’t, its not there.""
"Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all thesame stuff."
"Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the nightand have those long talks about our feelings and the future."
"Not once did we do that."
"(entering) Hi."
"Hey!"
"Hi."
"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us."
"Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?"
"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. Shewasn’t angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)"
"And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friendcry?"
"I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that toomuch to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as youguys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I meanwe-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!"
"Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of anera! No more J-man and Channie’s!!"
"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!"
"You got married again."
"Yes."
"So that’s your second marriage in two years."
"Yes, second in two years. Third overall."
"Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I somuch business from one client. Why don’t you tell me what happened."
"Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…"
"(interrupting) I’m sorry, is this the same Rachel who’s nameyou said at the altar in the second marriage?"
"Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do"
"Oh, that’s better then."
"This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled."
"I see. Have you considered therapy?"
"I think just the"
"There are a couple of forms to fill out."
"Easy."
"And we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were notof uh, sound mind."
"No problem."
"And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge."
"Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda allready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of."
"Of course you did. Look Ross, you can’t get an annulment unlessyou and Rachel are both there."
"Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.)I will think about the therapy."
"Hey!"
"Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up ourstuff."
"Okay!"
"Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the"
"Okay."
"Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh?Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know,too many memories!"
"(grabbing the star) What the hell is that?"
"I don’t know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey,Rachel, you want the big plate? I want"
"Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!"
"Something to remember me by!"
"Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know,I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time."
"But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!"
"Are you okay? You’re not blinking."
"I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end ofera."
"Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’tthink six years counts as an era."
"An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it wassignificant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!"
"What is the matter with you?!"
"What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?!Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I meanaren’t you gonna miss me at all?!"
"All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s justa little hard to believe."
"What’s hard to believe?"
"Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff!Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! Iguess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’msorry."
"Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here."
"But I…"
"No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that wejust, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. Andit"
"It is? Really?"
"Yeah, sweetie."
"(starting to lose her composure) I mean we’re not, we’re notgonna live together anymore?"
"No."
"What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.)"
"I’m gonna miss you! (They hug.)"
"I mean it’s the end of an era!"
"I know!"
"(to Joey and Chandler) Okay, bye!"
"Oh no."
"So? Did you get the annulment?"
"I couldn’t."
"I knew it! Because you love Rachel."
"It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…"
"Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love."
"I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right nowabout the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay?Would I do that if I loved her?"
"I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her."
"I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)"
"Ohh, what’s wrong?!"
"Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out andeverything is changing."
"Oh my—Come here! Come here! (He hugs her.) It’s okay.Everything’s gonna be okay."
"Thank you."
"Of course."
"So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married,do you think you and I should hook up?"
"Oh we do, but not just yet."
"Really?! Well, when?"
"Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthyrich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out."
"Wow."
"I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money andyou’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids."
"Great!"
"But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married.We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will beeasy because of Rachel’s drinking problem."
"Oh-oh, what about Ross?"
"I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words andI kill him."
