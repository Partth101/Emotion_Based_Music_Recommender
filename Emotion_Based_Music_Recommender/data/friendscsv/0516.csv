"Wow!"
"Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don'tserve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? Ithink I can come up with something better than that."
"Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge."
"Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'mat the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzyhas been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers inhope.)"

"What?! You say that to kids?!!"
"No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies."
"Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch."
"You picked a great couch."

"Yeah!"
"You two are really gonna enjoy that couch."
"Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of thestore.)"
"Ohh, okay. (Laughs.) Something didn't quite add up there. (Rossstops, walks back to talk to the salesman, and in the process pushes Rachel up against awall.)"
"Ross!"
"What's that supposed to mean?"
"Ross!"
"Well you, her, I mean, she's very…y'know. And you'relike…y'know."
"Not that it's any of your business, but we"
"Really? You two?"
"Yeah! Rach?"
"Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying avery heavy couch."
"Then tell him quickly."
"(To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out."
"Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!"
"Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are"
"A loser you did it with (To the salesman) 298 times!"
"Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?"
"Yes?"
"You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!"
"Yeah I can, it worked real well."
"No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again."
"I won't! (Turns away) Until I have my next cigarette."
"Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!"
"What?!"
"Yeah that's right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book'em."
"Who are you talking too?"
"Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, youapologize to the tree."
"I am"
"You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (Thewoman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!"
"I-I'm sorry! Sorry."
"Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!"
"Okay. (Throws off the last cushion.)"
"Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?"
"Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go."
"Okay, go left. Left! Left! (The bottom of the couch is hitting therailing.)"
"Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!"
"Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head!You can do it! You can do it! (She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) Okay.You got it?"
"Yeah."
"Good-good-good."
"Oh-oh!"
"Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?"
"Any chance you think the couch looks good there?"
"…so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide.(Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!"
"(cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!"
"I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds."
"Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You couldget arrested."
"You could get arrested, right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare ather.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads forthe door just as Joey enters.)"
"(To Joey) Hey."
"(To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh."
"Hi, Joe."
"Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here."
"Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)"
"(backing away) What?! Why?!"
"What is going on with you?"
"Nothing!"
"Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!"
"All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don'twant to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)"
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had saidthat? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! Idon’t want to talk about it."
"Well, it involved Monica."
"You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!(To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.(Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) Ilove you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)"
"Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamtabout her like that since I found out about you two--ish."
"What was the dream about?"
"Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and"
"Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love withme!"
"It-it doesn’t?"
"No!"
"No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealousbecause I've become the apartment stud."
"That kinda sounds like your dream dude."
"Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and wey'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too."
"In the dream I did enjoy the closeness."
"Um-hmm."
"Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, areyou attracted to her?"
"(looks at her) Not really."
"Well there you have it!"
"Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowlyrealizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because youjust want a girlfriend!"
"No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? Imean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, buty'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?"
"Well y'know, Monica and I were"
"Friends first? That's interesting."
"You become friends after?"
"No, never done that either."
"(entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?"
"Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom."
"(laughing) That's right."
"(noticing him) What's up Joey?"
"(in a sexy voice) How you doin'?"
"Excuse me, is this your car?"
"Yeah."
"Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you'reblocking the entrance."
"Don't worry about it. It's not a problem."
"Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'causeI'm a cop. (Shows the badge.)"
"(he reaches into the car and slams his siren on the roof.) So am I!"
"Ohh, no. (Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can parkanywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work.10-4. (Tries to leave.)"
"(stopping her) Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?"
"I-I'm with the umm, the 57"

"I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore."
"Who-who else is in vice up there?"
"Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?"
"Sipowicz? No, I don't think so."
"Yeah, big guy, kinda bald."
"No, I don't know him."
"(starts to walk away, but stops) Don’t try to call him or anything,'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died."
"Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss."
"I-I sure will, take care. (Starts walking off.)"
"(following her) Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right. Iheard that kid from"
"Oh. (She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runsaway.)"
"Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?"
"Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I canblow that off, (In a sexy voice) for you."
"Thanks!"
"Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talkingto Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight."
"I know."
"Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'mthinking of getting me one of those."
"What's up Joe?"
"Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…"
"Yeah?"
"…is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself,"Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…"
"(laughing) What are you saying?"
"I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch."
"Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw mefirst, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up."
"I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.)"

"Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…"
"Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. (Showing them) OkayRach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.)"
"Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? (Points.)"
"Oh, that's me."
"Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself."
"No! That's-that's my arm!"
"(looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, reallyliked your new couch."
"Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead."
"Okay!"

"All right, ready?"
"Yeah."

"Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit."
"Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! (Theystart up the stairs again. Chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) Pivot! Piv-ot!Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!"

"Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore."
"All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again."

"(To Rachel) Well look, hey, it's all your fault!"
"What?! Why?!"
"Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! Assoon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. Isuddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And herroommate!"
"What about the closeness?"

"Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!"
"Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you (Points at all of them) with me.(They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luckChandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. Butyou'll never make it stick and you know it!"

"I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest youtoday. Maybe I came by and you weren't here."
"I would"
"Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if youwould like to go to dinner with me?"
"Me?!"
