"Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir."
"Oh that is quite all right ma’am. (Elizabeth exits.)"
"So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot ofhomework to do?"
"Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow."

"Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice."
"Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it reallymeans a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are…"
"(interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?"
"Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?"
"Yeah. Do we have any"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing."
"Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too."
"Oh that’s good, I guess she’ll have a choice between my guyand your weirdo."
"Why would our guy be a weirdo?"
"‘Cause that’s just your taste."
"(laughs sarcastically) Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy."
"Oh yeah?"
"Yeah!"
"My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (Shesqueezes the skin on her chin together to form…)"
"A face ass?"
"A chin dimple!"
"Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s reallynice and smart and he’s a great dresser!"
"Have you seen your guy’s body?"
"No, our guy is just a floating head."
"Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and onetime umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it."
"You’re not supposed to look!"
"Oh yeah, like there are police for that!"
"(horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me."
"I know. (Laughs.)"

"Oh, Chandler funny?"
"Our guy’s a great dancer!"
"My guy is well read."
"Our guy has great hair."
"My guy has great teeth!"
"Our guy smells incredible."
"(To Chandler) Do you want our guy to be your guy?"
"Hey."
"Huh."
"Well, you…don’t look good Joe."
"The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream,limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?"
"That’s still in there?!"
"Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?"
"Is this a service you’re providing me?"
"No! No! No! For my new fridge—our new fridge!"
""
"So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple."
"Uh-huh."
"And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and Igotta buy a new kid."
"(not quite sure where Joey’s going and is a little worried)Okay…"
"(pause) Give me $400!"
"Professor Geller?"
"Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh, a student I don’tknow."
"I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?"
"Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?"
"Making out in your office."

"Oh-ooh!"
"What?"
"Doorknob! Doorknob!"
"Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you."
"Oh, okay. What-what about?"
"Spring vacation."
"Spring vacation."
"Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips…"
"Professor Geller!"

"You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a tripwith her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do Itell her?"
"Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready."
"I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?"
"Then you distract her with a"
"Or! You can just, y’know… (He walks up close to whisper inRoss’s ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)"
"What the hell are you doing?"
"What? What the hell am"
"What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!"
"Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!(He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! That’ll be $400!"
"Joey, I"
"(pause) You pushed him!"
"Joey, I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells insideand recoils in disgust.)"
"All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?"
"Uh-huh."
"I still haven’t gotten a check for your half yet."
"Do"
"I’m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!"
"You wanted to see me Professor Geller?"
"Yes. Yes! Please, come in."
"Oo-oo!"
"Doorknob?"
"Yeah, it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually, I wanted tofinish talking to you about uh, spring vacation."
"Oh good."
"Look, I… (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look, I’m havinga great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to muchpressure on us. So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet.It’s-it’s too soon."
"Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted totell you that I’m going to Florida for a couple weeks."
"No. I think you misunderstood what"
"You are so adorable."
"That! Let’s talk about that."
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?"
"Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. Shedidn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s goingto Florida for spring vacation."
"Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going forspring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)"
"What’s-what’s the difference?"
"Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents.Spring break you’re doing frat guys."
"Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that."
"What did you do on yours?"
"I went to Egypt with my dad."
"I can see it now, "Look dad, it’s the Sphinx!" (Doesthat party noise again.)"
"Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Springbreak!" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean she’s taken my class!"
"And slept with the professor."
"I’m gonna call her."
"Yeah."
"Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian."
"Hi."
"We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last"
"Can I get you a cup of coffee?"
"Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)"
"Rachel, what the hell is this?!"
"(shocked) What?"
"You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with yourown!"
"You found me a guy?"
"Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler’s work!"
"Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo."
"Well, y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but Ithink I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity."
"Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!"
"Uh, would you"
"Here you go. (Hands her, her cup.)"
"Oh, thank you."
"Sure."
"So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?"
"Uh, no not really. Why?"
"No reason, it’s just I know a single guy that cares about otherpeople."
"Are you funny?"
"Excuse me?"
"What are you guys doing?"
"Are you funny? Tell us a joke!"
"Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel."
"Well, so do a lot of people."
"Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. (To Rachel) Give me a callsometime."
"Oh, but y’know, no, you didn’t give me your phone number."
"Okay! See you later! (Exits.)"
"(To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny."
"I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because ofyou!"
"Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?"
"Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that thekind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like todance?" (Imitates him.) "Uhh, okay—I gotta go!""
"All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a veryinsensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we havetwo really great guys for you."
"Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up withsomeone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy."
"All right."
"Okay, so you will meet our guys?"
"Yes, I’ll meet ‘em."
"Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know?It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebedeemed not good enough to go out with herself."
"(entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me400 bucks!"
"Okay sure!"
"Really?!"
"Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on yourlast ten auditions."
"Call it even?"
"Okay."
"(To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?"
"Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo.That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies,waking up next to people you don’t even know…"
"Man, she is going to have a"
"You know the hotels?"
"Sure! I was there! Spring Break ’81! Woo-hoo!"
"In 1981 you were 13!"
"So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y’know whoknows how to party? Drunk college chicks."
"Okay, she can’t go."
"Ross, you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating."
"Then what am I supposed to do?"
"Nothing, you just have to be cool with it."
"Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?"
"Well, maybe you"
"I’m so glad you’re going on this trip!"
"Yeah! I’ve been working so hard this semester. I really need togo crazy y’know, blow off some steam."
"Sure. Sure. Look I don’t, I don’t know if your plans arefinalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam."
"What?"
"Are you into crafts at all?"
"Ross, are you okay?"
"Well, yeah, of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just beingsupportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-whatis uh, what’s this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)"
"It’s a bathing suit?"
"To wear in front of people?"
"Is that supportive?"
"Is this?!"
"Hey!"
"Good-good-good-good."
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hi!"
"We’re really glad you decided to meet our guy."
"Oh…"
"You’re gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meethim?"
"I don’t know. I know I don’t work late tomorrow night."
"Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y’knowwhat? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad comehere! (He stands up from the next table.)"
"What?"
"Eldad, this is Rachel."
"How are you?"
"Well-well a little blind sided but y’know good."
"Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!"
"I—Ohh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.)"
"There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)"
"Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! (They start to leave but run into Phoebewith her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe) What are you doing here?!"
"This is Patrick. (Points to him.)"

"Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about."
"Yeah?"
"Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what’sunderneath it."
"Oh-okay, but Pheebs?"
"Yeah?"
"I’m just sort of in the middle of something."
"Oh! Okay! Yeah, that’s okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (SitsPatrick down next to Rachel.)"
"No! You can’t do that!"
"Maybe I should go!"
"(stopping him) Sit down! We’re winning!"
"Okay, y’know what? Maybe I should go!"
"(Chandler stops her) No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!"
"Rachel! Rachel! You haven’t touched Eldad’s hair!"
"It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)"
"Yeah, I’m good."
"Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money."
"Y’know what Phoebe? This isn’t really worth the free massage."
"That’s right Patrick, bye-bye!"
"(To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (ToEldad) You dance for Rachel!"
"No-no! Don’t dance for me! Please? Don’t! (She gets up to yellat her ‘friends.’) What is the matter with you guys?"
"Yeah, okay, let’s talk it out."
"I… Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?"
"I’m a little embarrassed. (Chandler shushes him.)"
"I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Comeon! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!"
"Then why did she ask us to…"
"I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actuallyliked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on allthe cash, (He nods) and-and y’know—(Feels Eldad’s hair)—Wow! You dohave very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go throughanymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly,and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!"
"Yes, Papaya Extract."
"Thank you! (Storms out.)"
"So uh, have a great time down there."
"I will."
"Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?"
"Yeah."
"It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm,I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’mfine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure."
"Oh, don’t worry I have plenty of sun block, it’s SPF-30."
"Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes youget 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than notit’s just milk."
"Ross, it’s going to be okay. I’m not going down there tohook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us."
"Really?"
"Yeah! I’m just going down there to relax and hang out with myfriends."
"Okay. Cool."
"Oh hey! Here they are!"
"Elizabeth!"
"Call me!"
"Rachel, we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you."
"Oh that’s all right! Y’know, I ended up having a really goodtime. Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money andawareness."
"So what was it for anyway?"
"I wanna say a disease."
