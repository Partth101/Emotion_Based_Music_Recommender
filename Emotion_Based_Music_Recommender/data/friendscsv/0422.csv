"Of course!! (Shrugs.)"
"Hi, guys."
"Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe’s way.)"
"Hi Phoebe."
"I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgyyesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know."
"No we…"
"Hormones."
"…hormones, yeah."
"Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.(She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)"
"Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-howare things going?"
"Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels likeeverything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?"
"Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going toRoss’s wedding."
"Oh!"
"It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…"
"Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the streetand this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him."
"Well, h-how is this like that?"
"Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see"
"(starting to cry) I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…"
"Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)"
"Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the companythat sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if thisisn’t an emergency, then what is?"
"(entering) Hey guys!"
"Hey!"
"Hey…"
"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! Andthe guys from work had a blast. Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelorparty before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…"
"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!"
"Yeah, right!"
"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up formyself, I might want to get one of those…"
"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring andthe clothes on her back were all she had with her."
"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a littlesqueeze.)"
"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bridewho has worn it has had a long and happy life."
"So you might say, it’s a magic ring."
"(laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it."
"My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!H-how?! How could this all happen?!"
"Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, whydon’t you be my best man.""
"(dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I’m gonna call thecops!"
"Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!"
"Not on you! On the stripper!"
"Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look intoit right after they solved all the murders."
"Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!"
"I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number.They said, "If I bothered them again they’d call the police." I said,"If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!""
"So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’snothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!"
"Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…"
"Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had hercome to my office?"
"Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!"
"Here’s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take astep back.)"
"(sips it) It’s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh ofrelief.) Oh, thanks."
"Good."
"I’m so glad you liked it."
"(sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)"
"What?!"
"What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)"
"Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction."
"You what?"
"Oh my God!"
"Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know thatwas"
"Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’tsterilised it since the guys moved out!"
"Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what?It’s okay. I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and justrip up some sheets!"
"No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They saidthat, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book."
"Rachel, get the book! The book!"
"Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!"
"The Bible?!"
"I don’t know!"
"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why wouldshe? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’llbe uh, Mr. Wong."
"Diverse."
"Did anybody call for security?"
"(to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they allturn there backs on her.)"
"Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? (Sees Joey.)Hey, Joey?"
"Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where isit? Where is it?"
"Way to be cool, man."
"What’s he talking about?"
"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!"
"Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?"
"We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!"
"Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don’t need tosteal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guysmake that?"
"Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)"
"I don’t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn’ttake it, and I didn’t take it; and you (Chandler) didn’t take it, then who did?(The duck quacks.) Shh! We’re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at thesame moment and stare at Joey, who doesn’t get it. After a short pause, with the duckstill quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)"
"I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour."
"Well, do you"
"How do you feel?"
"Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess Iknow it’s going to be over soon."
"Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this."
"I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, whenyou’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing.I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila."
"Some moms do that."
"Okay that’s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myselfinto, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like Iknow them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these littlebabies have to go away."
"Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna haveanything. You’re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s evenbetter."
"Yeah, okay."
"No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worryingabout saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, ordeciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?"
"I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wannarun away from home, and the one they talk to about sex."
"And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!"
"Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!"
"Yeah."
"And y’know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you."
"They are gonna love me."
"Oh!"
"Thanks you guys! Again."
"Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)"
"You’re the best. Thanks. Oh!"
"Just kidding. Ahh!"
"What?!"
"Oh my God!"
"Got cha again, you guys are so easy."
"If anything should happen to him…"
"Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure."
"So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t makeit?!"
"He will, Joe."
"Yeah, but what if he doesn’t? He’s such a good duck."
"I’m so worried about him, y’know?"
"(coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?"
"Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it,and then does a double-take realising where it’s been.)"
"H-h-h-how’s the duck?"
"He’s doing just fine, he’s resting now, but you can seehim in a little bit."
"Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this."
"No, that’s all right."
"No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally letyou down!"
"Hey, come on, it’s not your fault."
"Yeah, it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? Y’knowwhat, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man."
"No, you should."
"Now, don’t argue with me…"
"Hey! Hey! Hey!"
"Really?"
"Really?"
"Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-aremy… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good… (They all start gettingemotional.)"
"Thanks man."
"(starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away sothat they can’t see him cry.)"
"What a baby."
"Total wuss!"
