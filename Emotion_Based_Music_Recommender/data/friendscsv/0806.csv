"That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!"
"Hi liar!"
"Hey!"

"Well they could be true."
"But they’re not!"
"Yeah, it’s a fine line huh?"

"Sure it does. Yeah, yeah."
"Well, I guess I’ll see you at the wedding. (Exits and Phoebe followshim into the hall.)"
"Umm listen, I don’t think…I don’t think I’m gonnamake it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world."
"I think we’ll be okay. Besides it’s so perfect and (whispering)she’s been saving herself for me."
"Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you."
"What?"
"She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. (She grabsUrsula’s purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) Okay. Okay.Yeah—Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.(Holds up her nametag.) Okay, here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she worksas a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here’s her driver license, thisoughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?"
"She told me she was 25."
"Oh, I almost don’t want to show this. (Hands it to him.) Justremember I’m a minute younger."
"I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She’s not a teacher.There’s not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children ofspies."
"No. You’re not, you’re not stupid."
"I’m not smart. (Phoebe has no comeback.) I just wanted so muchto…be impulsive once. To be romantic."
"That’s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic.Just…you did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?"
"It’s just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different."
"(yelling from downstairs) Eric!! Let’s go!!"
"I’d better go, deal…"
"Yeah, you should. (They shake hands.)"
"Hurry up I gotta pray!!"
"Hey!"
"Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying."
"That’s not so bad."
"No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh,I am just"
"Come on! You’re good with kids. They’re just crazy on Halloween.Y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!"
"Really? You think that’s all it is?"
"Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas…and theirbirthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they’re hungryor sleepy. Y’know, kids are tough. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)"
"Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost."
"Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win."
"(laughs) Is that a secret or a lie."
"No, I let him win—Ross!"
"Yeah?"
"Would you tell her I let you win please?"
"Oh. Yeah. (Sarcastically) Uh Chandler"
"I am strong! I’ll show you! (He sits down at the table.)"
"Chandler please!"
"Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?"
"Let’s go big bunny!"
"Okay. 1…2…3—Go! (Once again he’s at a stalemate,but this time he’s in pain.) (Pause) I’m gonna kill myself!"
