"Okay."
"I’m getting married next!!"
"Yay!"
"I"
"Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you startfeeling silly?"
"I guess."
"Oh my God!"
"Oh God."
"Oh, you’re such a cheater!"
"(entering) Hello! Little ones."
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?"
"Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They’restunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me."
"Oh, how’d that happen?"
"Because I’m cooler."
"No, seriously."
"Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious."
"(muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! What’s happening?"
"Oh my God!"
"What is that?"
"(muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonnahelp me not to snore."
"Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think youhave to wear it unless you are!"
"(takes out the mouth guard) I know I don’t have too! It tastes good.(Puts it back in.)"
"Plus, you look cool."
"(entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua…"
"Oh, how did it go?"
"Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girlwho is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time."
"What did he say?"
"Well uh, his answering machine was"
"Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything thathe’s gonna call you again."
"Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t thinkhe’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totallyokay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handlingit all that well."
"Yeah, maybe."
"And I-I am just trying to figure out why."
"Any luck?"
"Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, onagain, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be onagain."
"Again. Y’know what? I think we all did."
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emily’s wedding dress intoRachel’s room.)"
"So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about,Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?"
"Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three."
"Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three."
"Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there."
"What happened?"
"Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me."
"Noo. Why?"
"Well, apparently he scares easy."
"Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry."
"It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’dthought they would."
"Come here."
"(breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily?"
"Yeah."
"Yeah."
"You okay?"
"Yeah! I got my girls."
"Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe’s lap.)"
"(looks at Monica) Hey, y’know what might cheer you up?"
"What?"
"Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood."
"Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause)Maybe someday, there will be."
"Oh God! He’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his bigdate!"
"Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)"
"No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!"
"No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!"
"I’m not gonna marry Chandler!"
"Not after this!"
"Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as shedoes, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it’s Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on thedoor.)"
"I gotta go."
"Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, thatoughta do it."
"(muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am"
