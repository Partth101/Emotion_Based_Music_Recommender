"Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married?Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!"
"Do you realize you get louder each week?"
"There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?"
"I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow.(Laughs)"
"Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding."
"Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?"
"No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say."
"Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?"
"(handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Let’s just do it right now.Okay? It won’t be hard. Just say what’s in your heart. (She goes back, sitsdown, and starts feverishly writing.)"
"(watching in her) (in his head)"
"(writing) Monica, there are no words… (To Joey and Ross) Thereare no words! This should not be this hard!"
"All right, uh… (To Ross) Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross,well what did you say when you made up your vows?"
"Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day Idie. She made no such promise."
"I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! Youshould’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!"
"Monica what?"
"What?!"
"What is the emergency?!"
"You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all Ihave is this! (Shows them what she’s been working on.)"
"Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress."
"Thank you."
"Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)"
"Those are my eyes!"
"Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)"
"Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm,Monica from the moment I met you, I"
"Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that."
"...everyone, this is Chandler!"
"Hi, I'm Ross's little sister."
"(seeing her) Okay."
"Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, eventhough we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.""
"All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man onEarth. Would you go out with me?"
"Ennnh."
"Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!"
"Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe youjust say something about y’know all the things that he’s taught you. Like…(They all try to think about one example and don’t succeed.) Or all the things youtaught him."
"Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labellingthem) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there’s more thanthree), five, six, and seven!"
"(shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) That’s one?"
"It’s kind of an important one!"
"Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down."
"Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what thatcould’ve meant.)"
"All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3,5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7,6-7, 7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…(mouths 7)! (They both lean backon the couch satisfied.)"
"Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica…"
"(writing) Monica…"
""…when I look back over our time together…""
"(writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?"
"Well, I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together."
"Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute."
"No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?"
"You'll get one."
"Oh yeah? When?"
"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us aremarried, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
"Why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
"No, no, no."
"What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?"
"(trapped) Uh, uh."
"Well?"
"Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the backof the chair he was sitting in)"
"Nice try."
"Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)"
"Look, Monica…"
"Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)"
"This is not going to work."
"I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)"
"You are so great! I love you!"
"What?"
"Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, Ijust stopped talking!"
"You said you loved me! I can't believe this!"
"No I didn't!"
"Yes, you did!"
"No I didn't!"
"You love me!"
"No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!"
"Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?"
"Then all your stuff would be here."
"Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
"Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean itdoesn’t make any sense."
"Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’msaying?"
"You wanted it to be a surprise."
"Oh my God."
"Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.(Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s areason why girls don’t do this!"
"Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God,I thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) Ithought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thingthat matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.(Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my lifetrying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will youmarry me?"
"Yes."
"(yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!"
"Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.)We’re engaged!!!"
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hey, what have you guys been up to?"
"Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out becauseJoey kept making inappropriate suggestions."
"How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?"
"How’s Monica coming along with her vows?"
"Well let’s just say its she’s lucky she has a sweet ass,‘cause she’s not so good at the writing."
"I can’t believe in four weeks they’re gonna be married!"
"Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know nine out of tenmarriages end in divorce?"
"Phoebe that’s not true."
"Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?"
"I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years."
"(shocked) Has it been that long?!"
"Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long."
"Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!"
"I've had a very long, hard day."
"Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?"
"Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then."
"Okay."
"Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me aboutchicken."
"Chicken? I could eat some chicken."
"Hey Joe!"
"Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a"
"I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us."
"I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it."
"(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!"
"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!"
"How?! When?!"
"It happened in London."
""
"The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make abig deal out of it."
"But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!"
"No-no-no-no-no! You can't!"
"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?Just promise you won't tell."
"All right! Man, this is unbelievable!"
"(on phone) I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'mgonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours."
"(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel isabsolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)"
"(on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…"
"Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace aroundwondering what to do.)"
"(looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Startsyelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothesoff.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!"
"What?!"
"(screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!"
"Oh my God!"
""
"OH MY GOD!!!"
""
"Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!"
""
"I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!"
"YOU KNOW?!!!"
"Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stopscreaming!!"
"(entering) What's going on?"
"(trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)HI!! Hi!"
"What?! What?!"
"Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get thisapartment!"
"Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebestarts jumping to divert his attention.)"
"(Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her andRachel.)"
"Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachelknows?"
"Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of usknow that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets wouldfinally be over!"
"Or, we could"
"All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie."
"Bye!"
"Bye!"
"Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (Shepinches his butt.)"
"(after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriateand the pinching!!"
"Actually, I did!"
"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
"Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!"
"Phoebe knows about us!"
"Well"
"Them?! Who's them?"
"Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey."
"Joey!"
"And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!"
"Oh man, they think they are so"
"Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!"
"I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!"
"Are you kidding?!"
"No!"
"I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenlyand slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that weknow?"
"No."
"Joey!"
"They know you know."
"Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!"
"God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess withus?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,you can't say anything!"
"I couldn't even if I wanted too."
"Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to putlotion on her!"
"She's bluffing!"
"Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a littlemimic of her dance.)"
"He's not backing down. He went to get lotion."
"(entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!"
"Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandlerthe sooner this is all over and out in the open."
"Ooh!"
"Okay!"
"I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)"
"Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons."
"It's not my first time."
"You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!"
"Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?"
"Of course."
"Oh, you're-you're going?"
"Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and isshowcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra."
"(swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm veryhappy were gonna have all the sex."
"You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now."
"Not if I kiss you first."
"Ooh."
"Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
"Here it comes. Our first kiss."
"Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!"
"And why not?!"
"Because I'm in love with Monica!!"

"I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were inlove!"
"So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!"
"Well actually, Ross doesn't."
"Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
"(He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh… What are youdoing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.)"
"Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gottachange things."
"You really think it would be that different?"
"How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be havingkids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a"
"Well, things change."
"I don’t want them to move to a"
"It’ll be okay Joe."
"I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are."
