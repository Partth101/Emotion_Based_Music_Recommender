"Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw usout!"
"I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!"
"(to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!"
"But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?"
"Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hopingthat someone will help him get in touch with her."
"(on phone) I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy,old twit!"

"Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job asco-host!"
"Oh that's great!"
"A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's thekind of math Joey likes to do!"
"Ugh, PBS!"
"What's wrong with PBS?"
"Ugh, what's"
"Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?"
"Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in thisreally bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if Iwrote to"
"Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs."
"All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box.I didn't have keys!"
"I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed.Like-like you did with the babies."
"This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totallyselfish."
"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother?Talk about selfish!"
"What-what are you talking about?!"
"Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feelreally good right?"
"Yeah. So?"
"It made"
"Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless."
"Well, may I ask for one example?"
"Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!"
"That's because all people are selfish."
"Are you calling me selfish?!"
"Are you calling you people? (Chandler rolls his eyes.) Yeah, well sorry toburst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal onSanta Clause right?"
"I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evilgenius."
"(on phone) Hello."
"(on phone from London) Hello, Ross?"
"Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! (He picks up a lamp andhands it to Chandler, for no reason.) It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! (to Emily)Hi!"
"Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!"
"No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling!I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talkto me!"
"Really? About what?"
"Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I reallymiss you."
"I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do."
"(to the gang, whispering) She's talking."
"(subdued) Yay! (He motions for them to keep quiet, including Chandler whois still holding the lamp Ross handed him, before he goes off to talk to Emily inprivate.)"
"Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?"
"That he doesn't exist."
"Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.)"
"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?"
"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him."
"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?"
"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyoneyet."
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet."
"I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she everhad!"
"Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?"
"I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?"
"Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And"
"(entering) Hi!"
"Hey!"
"Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship."
"Yes!"
"That's great!"
"In London!"
"What?!"
"She wants me to move to London."
"But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that."
"What-what-what are you gonna do?"
"I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to Londonwith Ben."
"Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to anothercountry so you can patch things up with your new wife."
"It could happen."
"(To the pledge volunteers) How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!"
"This will be your phone."
"That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls."
"No you answer it and take pledges."
"But I'm the host!"
"No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones."
"You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray."
"Well, here's your phone doctor. (She walks away.)"
"I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guythat lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on hisfront stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful.That old jackass!"
"Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish."
"I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to threechildren and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!"
"(entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?"
"Sure!"
"If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secretboyfriend is better in bed than Richard?"
"Chandler! (Pause) Is he?"
"Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secretboyfriend."
"Why?! I mean if this guy was"
"All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to Londonwithout Ben."
"I understand that would be difficult."
"Yeah, would you"
"I don't know, it's just…"
"Oh-oh-okay, but-but"
"All right."
"All right, did you just say all right?"
"I did. Now I'm the idiot."
"Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonnabe like-like-like two idiots in love!"
"Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still."
"Yes, tell me."
"Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on thataltar in front of my entire family, all my friends."
"I know. I am, I am so sorry."
"And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catchingour plane with her."
"Again, very sorry."
"I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad justthinking of you being in the same room as her!"
"Emily, there is"
"All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work."
"Oh that is so great! That's…"
"(interrupting him) As long as you don't see Rachel anymore."
"So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes."
"Yes!"
"Ooh-ohh!"
"Great!"
"No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again."
"Why?"
"What?! You can't—what did you tell her?"
"I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposedto make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm"
"Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your bestfriends."
"Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife."
"Yeah."
"That's true!"
"Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cuther out of your life."

"No, you cannot."
"Thanks for the help, problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)"
"(answering it) Hello."
"(on phone) Hey Mon!"
"Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?"
"See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TVand that's good exposure."
"(Looking at the TV) You're not on TV."
"Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the womannext to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)"
"Hey, there he is! There he is!"
"Hello New York! (The woman bats his hand out of the way.)"
"(on TV.) Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Whocares, y'know? Now I got the legs…"
"How many times have I told you guys, you"
"(entering) Hi Chandler."
"Hey!"
"Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day."
"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing upcaterpillars."

"Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm, hey, umm, Joey'sgonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves."
"Yeah, so?"
"Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the bestyou'd ever had."
"Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass."
"Why?"
"Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happydance.)"
"What's your point?"
"(in a bored voice) PBS telethon."
"(on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you knowthat I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me."
"What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?"
"Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The beeis happy and I am definitely not."
"Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya."
"(Thinks for a moment.) Aw, dammit! (Slams the phone down.)"
"Back on in 30 seconds people!"
"Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?"
"Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man."
"Come on man! You've been here all day!"
"Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?"
"We're on in 3, 2, (points to Gary Collins.)"
"Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying theperformance of"
"(entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is"
"A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decisionwith a toy!"
"Ooh, it's not a toy."
"Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and loseone of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time beforeI'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I gotnothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then.Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads theanswer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads theanswer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!"
"All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sextonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me."

"$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what"
"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness tolots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a goodthing, but I'm not"
"And you don't a little good about donating the money?"
"No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster."
"A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks."
"Yeah, not the one I had my eye on."
"(on TV.) It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total!Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers…(Hewalks over to where Joey is sitting.) Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressedvolunteers, (Joey stands up.) Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!"
"Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV!Oh that makes me feel—Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and thereforeit's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)"
"(entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there'ssomething you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best."
"Keep talking."
"I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Whichwouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD."
"Really?"
"Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with meagain, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!"
"Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps intohis arms.) Oh my… When is Joey gonna be home?"
"Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts totake off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on."
"But, I just cleaned the bathroom."
"Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves."

"Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check?I'm waiting for a call from Emily."
"Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!"
"It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff."
"Like what?"
"Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants."
"Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help."
"No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without yourhelp."
"Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if youneed somebody to talk to… Hi!"
"Thanks."
"Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just giveit to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever shewants fixed. Just do it. (The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna"
"(answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Lookumm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it.(Rachel gives him a thumbs up.)

"Never done that before."
"Nope."
