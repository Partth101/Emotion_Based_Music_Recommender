"Did you just say Hi, Jew?"
"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likesit. Reaffirms his faith."
"Ben, dinner!"
"Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it'sbreast milk, and you're not supposed to do that."
"Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on herwrist and tastes it.)"
"What did you just do?"
"I licked my arm, what?"
"It's breast milk."
"So?"
"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
"What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)"
"What did you just do?"
"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
"You won't even taste it?"
"No!"
"Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?"
"Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it."
"Hey, where is everybody?"
"They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?"
"Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanksfor your jacket."
"Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. (Puts her hand in thepocket) Here are your keys, hon. (She takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, andnotices she also grabbed a receipt.)"
"Okay."
"Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53dollars?"
"You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card."
"And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?"
"That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent."
"Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?"
"Judy."
"Who?"
"Julie."
"What?!"
"Jody!"
"You were with Julie?"
"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because shewas my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, wewere...shopping."
"Oh. Oh my God."
"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me."
"Yeah, right.  Sure!"
"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry,all right. I never meant for you to find out!"
"Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (Waves the receipt)"
"That is not true!"
"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?"
"Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?"
"Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to"
"(on the phone) Hi, who's this? (Listens) Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?It's Monica. (Listens) Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. (Listens) Joanne, it's not assimple as all that, ok? (Listens) No, I don't care what Steve thinks. (Listens) Hi, Steve."
"Hey! (This wakes Chandler and Ross up)"
"How did we do?"
"Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out."
"I did not freak out."
"Why'd you freak out?"
"Because it's breast milk. It's gross."
"My breast milk is gross?"
"This should be fun."
"No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't thinkbreast milk is for adults."
"Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike."
"Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.(Holding out a bottle.)"
"(jumping away) That would be no."
"Come on. It doesn't taste bad."
"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
"Cantaloupe juice."
"Exactly."
"(staring at Susan) You've tasted it? You've tasted it."
"Uh huh."
"Oh, you've tasted it."
"You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true."
"(he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle andRoss squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes itoff.)"
"Howdy."
"(sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box ajuice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more peopleon it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goesthrough two bottles a day."
"(slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do youcare? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you."
"I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downsthe glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game.They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
"(pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that.You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. Andthen where're you gonna run?"
"Yeah I guess you're right."
"You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're madeof. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre westof the lingerie."
"I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)"
"All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nicehooker."
"I don't know what else to say."
"Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."
"I feel terrible, I really do."
"Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"
"Rachel, (they go back inside) say that I'm friends with her, we spendsome time together. Is that so terrible?"
"Yes."
"It's that terrible?"
"Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guywho might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually(starting to cry), but now she's actually stealing you."
"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean,just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,(starting to cry) you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."
"I love you too. (They hug.)"
"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do withme, but um I love you guys too. (Joins in on the hug.) Oh, I really needed that. (Goes andsits down.)"
"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need tohate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met aguy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.Would you just give that a chance, for me?"
"(crying) I'd do anything for you, you know that."
"(crying) I'd do anything for you. (They hug again.)"
"Wait, wait, wait, wait! (Runs over and joins in on the hug again.)"
"Mornin'. (The Hombre man ignores him) I said, mornin'."
"I heard ya."
"All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?"
"Ready."
"Yeah, I'm ready."
"You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!"
"Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?"
"I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."
"(seeing the end result) My god, what happened?"
"These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'.Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"
"Sure."
"So."
"So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, youknow, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us,though, right?"
"I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty muchtotally intimidated by you."
"Really? Me?"
"Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I reallywanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got thefeeling that maybe you don't."
"Well, you're not totally paranoid."
"Oy."
"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, itwas really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, butum, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um,Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
"Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime orsomething?"
"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."
"I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later."
"All right, Julie."
"Bye. (Gets up.)"
"Bye. (After Julie exits.) What a manipulative bitch."
"(with a mouthful) That's not bad."
