"Hey Rach, aren’t these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?"
"No-no, I bought those."
"Ohh! Yeah, I forgot."

"What?!"
"Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings,but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get."
"Phoebe that’s crazy!"
"I can’t believe she would say that too you."
"Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?"
"I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! Butshe also said one of them would be black."
"Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?"
"No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the veryend of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’veonly got a week left, y’know? I’ve"
"(entering) Hey everyone!"

"Oh that’d be great. Sure!"

"Oh, this is it. This what’s gonna kill me."
"(continuing) "…subcategories. The first of these subcategoriesis…""
"(interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on thatpiece of paper?"
"No! Why?"
"Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paperthat didn’t have naked chicks on it."
"Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) "Thereare three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.(Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each ofthese theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler)into…""
"Why don’t you open with a joke?"

"Ohh! We’re kidding! Oh, we’re kidding!"
"Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?"
"Thank you!"
"Some uh, some visual aides."
"Oh-ooh-ooh! Y’know what’s a good visual aide?"
"Please don’t say naked chicks."
"Why not?!"
"I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it.Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks."
"That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19."
"Hey."
"Hey! Any good mail?"
"Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild."
"Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me,I’m kinda…."
"(opens and reads it) "Benefits lapsed.""
"Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move calledbenefits lapsed."
"Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insuranceexpired because, you didn’t work enough last year."
"Let me see that!"
"All right."
"(reads it) Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insuranceI could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now Igotta be careful?!"
"I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to (pauses) stopcatching on fire."
"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see myagent."
"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
"(mocks him, in a whiney voice) …look both ways before you cross thestreet. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)"
"Hey!"
"Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?"
"Ugh, it’s"
"Pheebs, what-what are you doing?"
"I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Didthat not come off?"
"Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost youforever. Pheebs, you lie down?"
"Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm,wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can."

"Did-did you take these back?"
"No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought somefor myself."
"Oh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they?"
"I loved them!"
"Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)"
"(entering) Hello!"
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"How’d the lecture go?"
"It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!"
"Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t moresupportive before."
"I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself.Everyone’s all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved themwrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler."
"That you’re not funny or sexy?"
"That’s right!"
"(entering) Hey Estelle, listen…"
"Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They"
"What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always beenmy agent!"
"Really?!"
"Yeah!"
"Oh well, no harm, no foul."

"Bastard!"
"Hey!"
"(in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for metomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time."
"That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?"
"What?!"
"What’s wrong with you?"
"Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was liftingweights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. Butum, I don’t think it’s anything serious."
"This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!"
"No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anythingit’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and showsChandler.)"
"That’s a hernia."
"Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he wasusing.) Damn you 15s!"
"Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15minutes."
"Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch."
"Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I wasa Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches."
"(to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from thelaboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in factsedimentary. Imagine his consternation when—(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell."
"What the hell are you doing?!"
"Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring!I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this Britishaccent just came out."
"Yeah, and not a very good one."
"Will you-will you please?"
"Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I’m a professor in thepaleontology department here."
"Oh."
"Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?"
"(in his British accent) I’m sorry, I’ve got plans with mysister."
"(in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her ‘R’)"
"(in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monicaaside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?"
"(normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I can’t?! (To anexiting student in accent.) Top ‘O the morning to ya laddies!"
"Just please stop!"
"(in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year."
"Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.)Sit down! Will you"
"Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’sgetting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing."
"I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s justget that thing…pushed back in."
"Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and Idon’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks inI can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably startwith that laser eye surgery too."
"Hey!"
"Hey."
"Hey!"
"What’s going on?"
"Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing alittle laser eye surgery won’t fix!"
"Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (Heputs his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on"

"Sure, now I’m scared."
"No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay?‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday."
"Yeah, but I don’t wanna die!"
"No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!"
"Gimme ‘em!"
"No! They are mine!"
"You stole them from me!"
"You stole them from me!!"
"Gimme them!"
"You just wanna each take one?"
"Yeah that seems fair. We never use them."
"(entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have tospeak in a British accent?! What do I do?"
"Well…"
"Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and peoplewill think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America."
"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’reprobably not even listening!"
"They’re not listening too me?"
"Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you."
"Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?"
"I think you look fine."
"Whenever you’re ready."
"(in a gravely, painful voice) Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I’ve got asurprise for you.""
"Hold it. I’m sorry, the surprise is a new swing set,if you could play it a little less…intense?"
"Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just—hold on one second. (Heturns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (In a relaxed voice.)"Hey Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you!""
"Oh my God!!"
"So that’s why I feed my dog"
"That’s where you pick up the bag."

"Yes, this Russell, Ross’s divorce lawyer, just tell him that sinceI haven’t heard from him, I assume he’s decided to give the marriage a try."
"Ross got married again—Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!"
"(in his head)"
"What’s happening to your accent?"
"(British) Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense? (Giggles.)(American.) All right, I’m-I’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I wasreally nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I’m sorry. So, if we could justget back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands)About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.)

"Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am"
"(in the accent again) Well, hello Rachel!"
