"Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)"
"(on TV) While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets astraditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. (Joey isintrigued by the idea) Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guyswon’t live to see the fourth of July. (Joey starts to call a place to buy a littlebaby chick) Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead."
"(on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? ‘Cause Iwas watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!"

"I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef."
"What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)"
"Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?"
"What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?"
"I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Ovenand opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I cantotally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) ButPete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me."
"And you’re still not attracted to him at all?"
"Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-Ican’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade."
"Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re healthteacher."
"Oh, please."
"What? Honey."
"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday."

"Yeah, come here!"
"What-what was it you were gonna tell us?"
"Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!"
"Okay, good bye! (leaves)"
"So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it takefor the roller skating thing to happen."
"Umm, oh, about three months."
"Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the toplessthing kicks in."
"(entering carrying a box) Hey!!"
"Hey!"
"I got you something! Open it! Open it!"
"Okay. (He opens it and it’s a baby chick) It’s a chicken."
"It’s cute, huh?"
"Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?"
"Fowl? No. Women? Nooo."
"Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. Theyrequire constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’sof love."
"Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight,and talks to it like it’s a little baby.)"
"Easy Lenny."
"So? I mean have you thought about it?"
"Okay. Here’s the thing."
"Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What’s the thing?"

"All right."
"Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?"
"Yeah, sure. Good luck!"
"(rolling towards the office) I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She rollsthrough a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big crash, and see Monica roll past thedoor the other way.) I’m okay!! I’m all right!!"
"(to Pete) Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman."
"What?"
"I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?"
"Why would you say that?"
"‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there wassomebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if youspent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and..."
"You’re good. You’re good!"
"Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantialgift."
"Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?"
"Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?"
"Thanks a lot."

"Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the castfor drinks."
"Excuse me?"
"What?"
"I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebodycould be here with our chick!"
"Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock thismorning trying to get her back to sleep?"
"You don’t think I get up when you get up?"
"Ohhh, here it comes."
"Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come inand spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?Well I don’t think so mister!"
"Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!"
"And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?"
"That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant..."
"I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got thischick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?"
"I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick."
"I’ll take her back tomorrow."
"Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?"

"(she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has troubleopening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)"
"Wow! That aspirin dance really works!"
"(She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!"

"I’m fine, I’m fine."
"No you’re not."
"Yes I am!"

"No. I have"
"And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’mRachel Green. It’s nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates shaking handswith it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on,you probably have a broken rib!"
"Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be brokenthen."
"Rach..."
"But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready."
"Rachel..."

"Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t..."
"What? What?"
"We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle."
"No. No, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this. (Rachelis shocked) What?"
"Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this?"
"Well I, close your eyes, I just think you’re gonna like this a littlebetter, ‘cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the brush)"

"No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’sreally nice."
"Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I’m okay with that."
"You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the onewho hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job."
