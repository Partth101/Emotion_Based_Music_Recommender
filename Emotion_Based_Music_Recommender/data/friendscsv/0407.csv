"(entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathynaked! It was like torture!"
"Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a"
"It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s badenough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I thinkshe knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird likeenergy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seenher naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine herbody was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth!Smooth! (leaves)"
"Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?"
"Yeah! Oh my God!"
"Here you go."
"Great! All right, so I’ll call you later."
"Great! (leaves)"
"(rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?"
"That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight."
"Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) Sothings didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer."
"No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with hertonight, right after my early dinner with Casey."
"(shocked) What?"
"Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza bymyself! (Laughs)"
"Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!"
"Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?"
"Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having sex with an endlessline of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can’t believe he justsad that.)"
"What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive."
"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. ButCasey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense thatshe’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you."
"You got all that from the back of her head?"
"All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know?Make a choice, pick a lane."
"Who’s Elaine?"
"(singing) ""
"Oh, you could just go uh, ""
"Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’"
"Well umm, y’know, I used to play."

"Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it incollege. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound."
"Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worthit. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound."
"Yeah."
"He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was everyallowed to hear, "The Sound.""
"I wanna hear "The Sound.""
"Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, wellit’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?"
"Come on, play that funky music white boy."
"Yeah!"
"No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in—No, yeah,okay. (Runs out.)"
"Okay, guys."
"All right! Bring it on, you…"
"Here we go. (Plays one note) Y’know, I’ve-I’ve never playedmy stuff for anyone before, so it’s important that-that you understand it’sabout communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y’know, umm, youshould-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That’s whatI’m…"
"(interrupting) Oh my God! Play!"
"(At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific."
"Really, bitchin’!"
"Wow, it was so—wow!"
"Really?! I mean, really?!!"

"Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play youanother piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll beright back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I’m—I am so…(starts to break up and leaves)"
"Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!"
"Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers."
"What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plusit’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear."
"You mean like, music?"
"Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes, yes, your breastsare just as firm and juicy."
"Come in!"

"So is Joey around?"
"No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. Souh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?"
"I uh, don’t really have a preference. You?"
"I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) …of theboat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello."

"(to Phoebe) Hey!"
"Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!"
"Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want toplay anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?"
"Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah."
"Pheebs…"
"Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be reallyy'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.I…"
"See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I…I won’t play anymore."
"Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if Iknew I was depriving the world of your music."
"Yeah, okay."
"Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice."
"Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!"
"I kissed Kathy."
"What?"
"Are you serious?"
"Does Joey know?"
"No. Is there anyway,"
"You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends. (They alllook at her) Which we all appreciate."
"No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before youkissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside."
"Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Isit?"
"I think maybe, yeah."
"He loves you."
"Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!"
"Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe."
"Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea."
"I know, I remember that!"
"I remember you did."
"God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!"
"Well, Chandler, you’re gonna have to tell him."
"Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!"
"Because you do."
"Yeah, I know."
"Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this."
"Hey!"
"Hey! Samboucha Margarita?"
"Is that a real thing?"
"Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now."
"Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something."
"What’s up?"
"It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lotactually."
"You do?"
"Yeah."
"Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not mygirlfriend anymore."
"What?"
"Yeah, she broke up with me."
"Oh uh, when?"
"Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kindof scene, that’s why I let people watch."
"Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?"
"Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?"
"Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too."
"No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay."
"Yeah?"
"Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you came to me first."
"Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do."
"But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut outfor you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s intosome other guy. So…"
"See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to youabout. I-I think I know who the other guy is."
"Who?"
"It’s me. I’m the other guy."
"What?"
"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got totalking, and one thing to another and…"
"And what?! Did you sleep with her?!"
"No! No! No! I just kissed her."
"What?!! That’s even worse!!"
"How is that worse?!"
"I don’t know! But it’s the same!"
"Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I thinkI’m in love with her!"
"Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!"
"You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line."
"Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, thatyou-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!"
"Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!"
"Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like"Well, kinda.") Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will notlisten to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker thatI’m not gonna eat! You know why?!"
"Probably because…"
"Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on thisapartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either. (The bread makerdings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroomand slams the door.)"
"Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it."
"(removing ear plugs) What?"
"Phoebe, his music could not"
"Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it.Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish myset?"
"After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help."
"Yeah, like I could"
