"Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable."
"Gotcha."
"This place is really my Grandmother’s. (Joey starts to take off allof his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from herwhen she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if thelandlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are youthirsty?"
"Oh, you bet I am!"
"(turning around) Okay, here’s your penis!"
"Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!"

"So?!"
"Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?"
"Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!"
"Oh right, right."

"Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk."
"It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know,but... By the way I can still see it."
"Pheebs?"
"Huh?"
"Where’s your bed?"
"It’s not in the apartment? (Monica gives a ‘Come on’look) Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again."
"What?"
"Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live hereanymore."
"What are you talking about?"
"I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’tknow how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!"
"Everybody knows!"
"That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica,I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I gotlike a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions."
"Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over."
"Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the otherside."
"What?!?!"
"Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in aland where people can spill."
"You can spill. In the sink."
"Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and Ilove you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see thathappening."
"I love you, too."
"Aww, good. (they hug) What?"
"What? I’m just said."
"No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is."

"Well, I think so."
"Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of myfavourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life."
"(all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?"
"Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what iswrong?"
"My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over."
"Oh no! Why?"
"‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I’mnot one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation."
"Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny."
"(sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, manydrinks) I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out andshe’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know lookat her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool!"
"Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?"
"Well, now I do!!"

"Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can."
"Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen,it’s, it’s gonna be...."
"I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)"
"Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, orI’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!"
"I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross.You’re, you’re really, you’re so good. (kisses him on the cheek)"
"Thanks."

"Wait, wait, wait."

"My foot is stuck in the pocket."
"What?"
"No, I can’t get it out."
"Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear."
"No, come on don’t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!"
"What?"
"Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)"
"Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution."
"You have chalk on your face."
"Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)"
"Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought thiswas real grass."
"Hey, are you okay?"
"My wife’s a lesbian."
