(It’s abutchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreignfriends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)"
"Are you okay?"
"Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Iseverything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!"
"Yeah. I’m okay. I’m actually—I’m a little cold, canI have your jacket?"
"Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no youcan’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you weregoing to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, areyou okay? Are you okay?"
"(laughs) Are you sure you’re okay?"
"Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time nowand I think, the reason is you."
"Ohh that’s sweet!"
"Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and Icouldn’t imagine growing old with…"
"(interrupting him) Oh my God!"
"(not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just letme say it."
"Oh my God, Richard. (Yep, Richard’s back.)"
"What?! I’m Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandlerturns and looks) Oh, that’s Richard!"
"Oh God, maybe he won’t see us. Richard!"
"(approaching them with a woman in tow) Monica! Chandler!"
"Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I don’t know why I didthat!"
"Hey, it’s good to see you!"
"You too, you let uh, your hair grow long."
"Yeah—Oh that’s right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, Isee you got your mustache back."
"Well, my nose got lonely."
"(to Richard’s date) And uh, you don’t have a mustache whichis good. (She just smiles.) I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable."
"Hi."
"Oh, I’m sorry. (Introduces them.) Lisa, (nodding at each) Monica,Chandler. We used to date."
"Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles athim.) See I, did it again."
"Chandler, wh-why don’t we sit down?"
"Yeah, I’ll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)"
"(to Richard) It’s good to see you"
"(to Richard) You’re table’s ready sir."
"Oh. Good to see you guys."
"Yes. (Thinking he’s gone.)"
"(motioning to the empty table next to Monica and Chandler’s) Orif you prefer, this table is available."
"That might be fun. (Richard and Lisa sit down.)"
""
"I didn’t know it was an auction!"
"Wh?!"
"I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!"
"Why would a charity give away a free boat?!"
"I don’t know! Charity?"
"Ugh!"
"Well, just buy the damn boat! (She’s still working her way throughher tray of booze.)"
"Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?"
"I’m just helping the kids!"
"How is you drinking helping the kids?"
"Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink."
"(approaching) Mr. Tribbiani."
"Oh hi!"
"Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to buildingthe youth center."
"Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?"
"I think it was valued at 19,000"
"(To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so badnews. Umm, I can’t buy the boat, I don’t have any money."
"Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)"
"That’s good. Very good! (Walks away.)"
"So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)"
"(stopping him) Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed tobuy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonnakill me!"
"Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money!"
"I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. Allright, this is what we’re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, andwe are just gonna let them buy it, and then you’re just gonna pay the difference."
"Okay."
"Okay."
"Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway!Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!"
"Not great."
"And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom."
"And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in."
"So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re goingat it right on the bathroom floor."
"(laughing) Oh my God!"
"I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both myparents making love to the same guy."
"It’s so great seeing you guys again. I’d like to make atoast. (Everyone raises their glasses) Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness offriendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little thingsthe heart finds it’s morning and is refreshed.""
"Ohh."
"What?!"
"Oh my God, you guys!! (He’s excited about what he thought happened.)"
"(stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have wegot a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!"
"Who?"
"Richard!"
"What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh that’s right that’sright. That’s Richard’s favorite place too."
"Oh you knew that. Good!"
"I thought you were going out with Elizabeth."
"Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight."
"Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t getout of!"
"Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was overthere and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. Ifinally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do."
"Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationshipagainst the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first (looks at Chandler andpauses) weighing stuff."
"Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is."
"If the school finds out you’re fired."
"Hmm."
"She’s leaving for three months."
"For cam"
"Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and prettyand…"
"Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see afuture?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses inconsideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn’t you?!"
"No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay, honestlyno. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her."
"Okay well I think…that’s your answer."
"I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part."
"Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re notcareful you may not get married at"
"Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one."
"Oh great!"
"(To Phoebe) Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four."
"Oh, okay."
"(To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?"
"It’s a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-typethingy she’s wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.)Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?"
"That was me."
"Oh, en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he onlyshakes it.)"
"Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?"
"That’s me."
"Ahh, yes. (Pushes Rachel in front of himself so that she could do thetalking.)"
"Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman daysailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000."
"You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess."
"(To Joey) Okay. Okay. (Shushes him.)"
"I was actually relieved uh I didn’t win the boat. My wifewould’ve killed me."
"Ohh…"
"Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!"
"Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?"
"It’s Pam."
"Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam.""
"Aw-awww!"
"I don’t think she’d like that."
"Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont.""
"Oooooh…"
"I don’t think so dear."
"Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (She sits down next tohim.) All right, you are settin’ sail up the Hudson! You’ve got the wind in yourh—(sees that he’s bald)—arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet thatyou’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! Youcan—ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, andthen when you’re old, Cappy."
"What the hell, it’s for a good cause! All right!"
"No way! It’s mine!!"
"(To Joey) What?! What?!"
"All that stuff you just said? I want that!"
"But Joey you don’t have $20,000!"
"Who cares?! I-I’ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr.Bowmont!!"
"Oh my God, you’re back!"
"Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is franticallytrying to wave them off.)"
"Why do you want to see my hand?"
"I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash."
"Yeah."
"Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out."
"(suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebe’s wishes.)"
"(after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!"
"What happened?"
"Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!"
"What?! Noooo… (Phoebe gasps.)"
"I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, butnow you’ve ruined it!"
"We didn’t ruin it!"
"Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!"
"Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…"
""
"Good one! Yeah."
"This is terrible. What am I going to do?"
"Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure,so just throw her off the track."
"That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriageis the last thing on my mind."
"Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment!Convince her that you’re a little coward!"
"I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice."
"Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)"
"(entering) I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiotkeeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!"
"That guy’s still doing that?!"
"(entering) Hey! (Sees Monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) Oh my Godyou’re here, let me see your hand!!"
"No, you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!"
"(in his head)"
"(sticking her head out her window) Ross! Wait!"
"Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about…"
"You suck!!"
"What?!"
"Okay, break-up’s still on!"
"Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do Ilook? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?"
"Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at eachother.) I never noticed that before."
"(entering) Hi guys!"
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"What are you up too?"
"Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.)Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary itis and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you."
"(laughs) Yeah, Big Brother."
"Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hearthat you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet."
"Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, whywould anybody ever want to get married huh?"
"Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! Todeclare your love for one another to the world!"
"Eh…"
"Okay well that’s good to know."
"(all excited) The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!! (Jumps over the back off thecouch and runs out into the street.)"
"Hey Monica, there’s a customer who wants to complement the chef,should I let him in?"
"Sure, I love this part! (Starts to look busy.)"
"(to the customer) Come on in."
"Hi!"
"Richard!"
"Actually, I’m not here to complement the chef."
"Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back tocomplement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up?"
"Well, it was great seeing you the other night."
"Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?"
"No! I came here to tell you something else. (Pause) I came here (Pause)to tell you I still love you."
"What uh—What did you—What?!"
"I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn’t even be heretelling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you sayhe’s straight I’ll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if Ididn’t tell ya I’d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was thestupidest thing I ever did."
"Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!"
"Well yeah, I’m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrongplace but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wannahave kids with you."
"Oh God… (Starts looking around.) Why don’t they put chairsback here?!"
"I know this is crazy but am I too late?"
"What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three yearsago?!"
"Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did!Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent"
"What were you doing in Africa?"
"Working with blind kids."
"Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry butumm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen."
"Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away. And I’ll never botheryou again, but"
"Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, infact, I’m the one that’s making"
"You are?"
"Yeah!"
"Why?"
"Why? Because of the government."
"Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married."
"I know, they’re gonna be"
"Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does thathappen?"
""
"No! I’m so happy for them!"
"Me too! So happy for them!"
"I’m so happy and not at all jealous."
"Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!"
"I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I meanwhat’s 2%? That’s nothing."
"Totally. I’m like 90/10."
"Yeah me too."
"Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?"
"(staring at him) Wh—no, but y’know who did stop in herelooking for ya, Tennille."
"So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’treally believe that do you?"
"Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage isunnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigsdon’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in alifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!"
"Yeah, but that’s"
"If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what thedivorce rate in this country is? 97%."
"Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may"
"Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never."
"Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!"
"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind ofstrategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!"
"Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!"
"(to them) It’s okay, I got a plan."
"We’re gonna find love!"
"Definitely!"
"Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it soeasy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a littleguarantee though."
"What do you mean?"
"Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neitherof them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other."
"You mean a backup?"
"Exactly!"
"Yeah, yeah I got that."
"You do?"
"Hm-mmm."
"Who?"
"Joey."
"Joey?!"
"Yeah!"
"Are you serious?!"
"Yeah, I locked him years ago!"
"Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re40, you’re gonna marry Joey."
"Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted toseal the deal."
"Oh, seriously?"
"Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were… (She makes two clickingsounds with her tongue and purrs.)"
"Charming."
"Well hey, it’s just a backup."
"Yeah."
"Hey Monica!"
"Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?"
"This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?"
"Yeah, it’s great."
"Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!"
"I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re ina dead-end relationship!"
"Chandler giving you a hard time huh?"
"It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just thatI-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually goingsomewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!"
"Well, you know Chandler."
"No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’slike something’s changed."
"Maybe you changed?"
"I didn’t change!"
"Maybe that’s the problem."
"What?!"
"Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife."
"Is that some kind of boat talk?"
"I don’t know! (All excited) I haven’t totally decided how totalk on my boat yet."
"What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around fornothing?"
"Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!"
"(starts for the door) Well there’s some people who do want to marryme."
"There are?"
"Yeah! Richard!"
"R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-andChandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!"
"That’s right."
"Chandler"
"You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complexfellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and alwayswill be!"
"You got"
"What happened you guys?"
"Rach!"
"Hey you!"
"Hey, come on in."
"Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you andElizabeth."
"Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, butuh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be."
"Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?"
"I guess so."
"So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by thetime we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, andwe’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprisesthere! You know what I mean? No like, "What’s that?!""
"Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup."
"Exactly."
"Ohh, yeah I already have one."
"What? Who?"
"Phoebe."
"Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just, she said that Joey was herbackup."
"Ohh, I don’t think so."
"Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joeymade a deal!"
"That’s impossible! I mean"
"Where the hell have you been?!"
"I was making a coconut phone with the professor."
"Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!"
"What?!"
"Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing withher and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldn’t keepflying off!"
"My—Oh my God!"
"I know! They suck!!"
"He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’msupposed to do that!"
"I know!"
"Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna goover there; I’m gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!"
"Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is asolution. Okay? Just"
"You’re right."
"Yeah!"
"Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) I’m gonna get the ring!I’m gonna get the ring! (Does so) I’m gonna go find her and (starts running forthe door) I’m just going to propose!"
"Okay."
"Okay great."
"Dude-dude-dude!"
"What?!"
"Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat."
"Hi."
"Hi."
"I don’t know why I’m here."
"I didn’t ask. You wanna come in?"
"I don’t know."
"Oh, okay. Well, I’ll just leave the door open and go sit on thecouch. (Does so.)"
"(entering) Chandler is such an idiot!"
"(standing up quickly) Drink?"
"Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…"
"…on the rocks with a twist? I remember. (Goes to make her drink.)"
"(moving over to the couch) Still smoking cigars?"
"Uh, no! No! That’s…art! If it bothers you I can put my artout."
"No that’s, that’s okay."
"So Monica let me ask you a question. Y’know, since we broke up doyou ever, think about me?"
"Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago."
"Oh really?"
"Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my neweye doctor."

"Well I’m sorry."
"And what does she have to think about? I love her!"
"Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not."
"But I"
"Well if it helps, it worked very well."
"It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, thisisn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! Andthis is my chance and I am not going to blow it because"

"I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!"
"She’s gone."
"What?"
"She’s gone. She had a bag and she left."
"What are you talking about?"
"She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and thatand that she needed time to think."
"Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell herit was a plan?!"
"I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believeme."
"Well where… Where did she go?"
"To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. Butif I were you I would."
"I can’t believe I ruined this."
"I am so sorry man."

"Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought…(Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that itmattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters isthat you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cryagain.)
