"So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?"
"So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?"
"Yeah. It's actually our first official date"
"Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?"
"Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at."
"What must it be like not to be crippled by fear  and self-loathing."
"(pause) It's OK!"
"How can you be so confident?"
"Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!"
"Really? Like you have a routine?"
"No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have  to appreciate their uniqueness."
"Really?"
"No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes.  Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh."
"You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh  in a funny and awkard way)"
"NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts  lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)"
"Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. (They  look at each other, both embarassed)"
"More foosball?"
"...and beer!!"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey!"
"(to Chandler) Hey sweetie! (they  kiss)"
"(looking at Monica's legs) WOW!"
"Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop  staring at your sister's legs!"
"I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?"
"She went on one of those spray-on tan places."
"Eh, you got a spray-on tan?"
"Chandler gets pedicures!"
"(laughing) Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?"
"(To Monica) Why...why?"
"Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean,  it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!"
"Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can  really show it off."
"So, do you get colours or just French tips?"
"There. Here's their card."
"Thanks. (he takes the card) Hey, I know where this  place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he  is saying) florist. (he goes away)"
"Hey!"
"Hey Pheebs!"
"Hey Phoebe!"
"Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town."
"I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me  too! She's the worst!"
"Who's Amanda?"
"She's this girl who used to live  in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up  this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda  using an awful British accent) "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!""
"Are you trying to do a British accent?"
"(pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets  pedicures!"
"Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?"
"You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on  the phone? (apes Amanda in a british accent) "Oh, so sorry to catch you  on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call  me on my mo-Bile!""
"I know, and she's always bragging  about all the famous people she's met."
"Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel".  All right, who hasn't?"
"Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't  wanna see her!!"
"Ugh, Let's just cut her out!"
"What?"
"Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and  dodge her 'till she gets the point!"
"Oh, I guess we could try that, but...  it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?"
"No, had it done to me though. Feels good !"
"Well... I like how you look, what are you?"
"Puerto Rican."
"Two, I think a two."
"You've got to face the red light.  When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes.  When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks  then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?"
"Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat."
"Wow, you catch on quick."
"Well, I have a PhD, so... (assistant walk out, not  impressed by this statement)"
"One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...(the sprayer  starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've  not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)"
"You sprayed my front twice!"
"You've never turned?"
"No, I barely even  got to three Mississippi."
"Mississippi? I said count to  five'!"
"Mississippilesly? (pause) Well, how  bad is it?"
"Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps  getting darker for the next four hours."
"So, how dark is it  gonna get?"
"You got sprayed with two two'  s and..."
"I'm a four?"
"Yeah, but you're back's a zero.  You're gonna wanna even that out."
"(sarcastically) Really!"
"You might wanna get back in there."
"(annoyed) Ok!"
"Wait, wait a minute, there's no light  on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns  and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns  again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out  of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing  happened again!"
"You got two more twos?"
"(hysterically) I'm an eight!"
"I thought you paid. (Rachel does not answer and seems  puzzled) Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!"
"So."
"Yeah."
"Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of  the couch?"
"I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok."
"What’s the matter?"
"I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t  know why I did that!"
"Okay"
"Ok, so sorry."
"I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don’t  know what happened, I must be nervous!"
"I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!"
"Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t  do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great."
"Ok."
"(a little giddy) Uh, was that good for you?"
"Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could  baby-sit again."
"It could be Amanda!"
"Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about  Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!"
"Hello Monica. It’s Amanda calling again. I  am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!"
"You're from Yonkers! Your last name  is Buffo-Martisis!"
"Let’s see.. to assure you get this directly,  ring me back on my mobile."
"Ok, don’t hold thy breath!"
"Hello? Is someone on the line?"
"Yes, I was looking for Monica."
"Hang on, she’s right here. (he enters the  living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya."
"We weren’t picking up, it’s  Amanda!"
"(to Amanda) I get pedicures!"
"Hi Amanda! Actually now... it’s...  is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe  and I will see you then!"
"Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!"
"Well, I said 'no' to her coming  over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to  please people!"
"(leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well  under torture!"
"And you would?"
"I did!"
"Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a  little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some  getting used to."
"Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?"
"Ok, let’s work from the top down! (Joey nods,  but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!"
"Ok, yeah, got it."
"Okay."
"This thing welded shut?!"
"Okay."
"All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this  thing."
"Oh!"
"Ow!"
"Sorry!"
"Well this is romantic!"
"I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me  before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can  do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!  I blame your bra!"
"It’s a standard issue bra clasp!"
"Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me  off with all your slapping!"
"Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey,  but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't"
"(contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said)  NAH! I don't have another level!!"
"Hold on! There is"
"I went to that tanning place your"
"Was that place..."
"Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler  and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body,  where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)"
"Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory  all by yourself!"
"How could you mess this up? It's  so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!"
"(looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?"
"One Two Three..."
"(Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel  just enters, sees him and starts laughing)"
"(laughing) oooh! Oh oh!"
"(Still yelling) I Know!"
"oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?"
"How was your date with Joey?"
"Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,  and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and  I kept slapping it away!"
"You didn't"
"Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out  too! He couldn't even undo my bra!"
"Wow, really? One time he just looked  at my bra and it popped open."
"I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have  kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere  and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me."
"Well, you guys have been friends  forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was?  You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that."
"(looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true,  we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna  power through!"
"Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points  to the hall)."
"(To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are"
"(sees what he is doing) Chandler,  stop! It is"
"(without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't  know! (Monica just smiles)"
"Hey Phoebe!"
"Hey!"
"Is Amanda here yet?"
"No."
"(sits down) Oh good. Good, look  I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan.  Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency."
"Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both  out of here?"
"Well, what do you think of Mike  and Chandler being in a car accident?"
"(makes a face) Are you kidding, I"
"Hi!"
"Hi!"
"Hi! (Phoebe and Amanda hug)"
"(To Monica) Hello!"
"(In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you!  Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as  well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch  my abs (at which point she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places  them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! (she pulls them down to  sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!"
"(beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is  Chandler and..."
"(To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's  not perfume! It's"
"Musty!"
"Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like  old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!"
"When were we not friends?"
"Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was  the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly)."
"Ehm, we were friends in 1992."
"(to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging  her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her."
"(To Phoebe) You were going to cut  me out?"
"Well...kinda."
"Oh My God!"
"Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like  a perfect arse!"
"Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass"."
"(Into the phone) Hello? Chandler,  what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more)  Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry,  but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)"
"(Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my  God. Was Mike with him?"
"Nope! (She turns and leaves)"
"(To Rachel) Hey!"
"Hey! Got champagne?"
"Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!"
"Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone  is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove  her bra from under her clothes)..."
"Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him)"
"Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very  sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright!  Lets do it!"
"Ok, you're scaring me a little bit."
"Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She  pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like  that huh?"
"Oh! yeah!"
"You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively,  putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She  pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between  his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)"
"uh uh!"
"Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!"
"No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!"
"What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?"
"(He just sits there, legs very close together with  a painful look on his face) Soldier down!"
"We are not friends with Phoebe anymore."
"If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!"
"Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can  I talk to you outside for a minute?"
"I have"
"(announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow,  my flat is"
"Please, Monica? In the hall?"
"Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look  positively ghastly."
"Well, aren't you a treat."
"I can't believe you tried to cut  me out. Why Phoebe, why?"
"It was right after we were living together and you  were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and  shrill."
"I'm still all those things!"
"You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!"
"(starts smiling) I am scrappy."
"Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't  keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only  one who ever clawed her way back in."
"It's because I'm scrappy."
"Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your  way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you."
"I won't know what I would do without  you."
"Well, I guess we should go back  in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda."
"Yeah, I guess you're right."
"Can you believe it. I've never had any professional  dance training."
"Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the  booth, and..."
"Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the  booth, and..."
"I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does  it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them  all on my back."
"(quietly) Okay..."
"Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one  is it?"
"Which... which... which... Which one is it?"
"OH! SON OF A BITCH!"
"What is the matter with us?"
"What is the matter with us?"
"Well, I know what's the matter with me."
"No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed  to be this... difficult?"
"I don't know."
"That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she  sure can dance... Hey!"
"Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When  you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more  than that?"
"Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide  from you guys..."
"No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally..."
"Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it  was... really wrong?"
"Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt  like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time."
"I can tell from your expressions that that's the  good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the  joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)"
"Well, just because it happened that way for them  doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us."
"Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's  difficult doesn't mean that you quit."
"Right, totally."
"Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...  do it."
"Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one  of those couples that never have sex."
"That's a... pla-an."
"(sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming."
"I know."
"Hmmm... Me too..."
"I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?"
"I guess they weren't as good friends as we are."
"Aah... I bet you're right."
"So..."
"Yeah."
"I love ya."
"Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed."
"Yeah, me too."
"Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while."
"Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in."
"Go away! I don't want to see anybody."
"I know, I went to the tanning place and the same  thing happened to me. You have to let me in."
"Really? Did you count Mississipily?"
"Dude, you're not tanned."
"No, I just had to get a picture of this."
"I see you later!"
