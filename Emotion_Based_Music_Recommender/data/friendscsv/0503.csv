"Hey."
"Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets."
"This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is thatanother doctor?"
"Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz."
"All right."
"It's not"
"It's"
"To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie…"
"(interrupting) What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Justget me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!"
"Again, it's not that he…"

"Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie orany of the"
"Hi! And you're going into what grade?"
"Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, yousee, I-I graduated early…"
"(interrupting) Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified thatI'd be needing a grown up doctor."
"Oh no, I'm fully qualified to…"
"Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be havingbabies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!"
"Oh cool! You made him cry!"
"Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones."
"Umm, well, what else could it be?"
"It's kidney stones."
"Or?"
"Kidney stones!"
"All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies arevery, very lucky."
"They are. Why?"
"They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday."
"Happy birthday!"
"Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie. (Phoebe nods in agreement as heleaves.)"
"Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrificthing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice."

"Yeah!"
"Can I tell you a little secret?"
"Yeah!"
"I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.)"
"Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!"
"Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you"
"Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!"
"Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep"
"Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they'rey'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss anopportunity just because I didn't"
"Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane."
"Oh, just ask him!"
"Me?!"
""
"No! Forget it! I am"
"You're right."
"Tell him it's for you."
"Feeling a little better sweetie?"
"Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up."
"Me too."
"(entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?"
"Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break upthe stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means wecan either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra…"
"(interrupting) Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up,up is not an option—what's a urethra? (Monica whispers what it is in his ear.) Areyou crazy?!"
"(To Rachel) So did you ask him?"
"No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet."
"Well, I'm kinda on a clock here."
"(laughing) Oh Fonzie."
"Y'know who I always liked? Mork."
"Undo it. Undo it. Undo it."
"Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie."
"Yeah, but umm… Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn'thurt, right?"
"Yeah, that's right."

"So, I'll call you tomorrow."
"Great!"
"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goofaround with him."
"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing aroundin the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends whocare a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to,y'know, get you my original dictionary.

"Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah."
"So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in thatlittle petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but theywere wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home andsee you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sisterhas a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Littlehigh fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.)Well, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)"
"Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!"
"I know."
"So does it really hurt as bad as they say?"
"Yeah. You won't be able to take it."
"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are theygonna name her?"
