"Hey!! We are"
"(Returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) Huh?!"
"Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!"
"Uh-huh. This"
"Could we"
"Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be agreat way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect."
"Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Momwould’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do."
"(entering) Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?"
"Just pickle."
"Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on thestreet yesterday."
"My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward."
"Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get adrink."
"(laughs) No. No!"
"Well, not at first."
"What is she doing here?"
"I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her yousaid she was a ‘big, dull dud.’"
"Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time wewere able to take the relationship to the next level."
"Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everydayoccurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself."
"Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will endit."
"Okay, I promise, I’ll end it."
"Yeah-eh-eah! (Rachel glares at him) Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew whathe meant."
"(entering) How’s the hired help?"
"Doing great, the quiches are coming along."
"What’s this? Blue nail polish?"
"Ahh, that’s what your Grandmother’s handslooked like when we found her."
"Let me ask you a question."
"Why did you hire me?"
"Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, ofcourse you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was verynice, I assume you weren’t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that wouldbe something. (Leaves)"
"(to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me becauseshe thinks I’m good."
"Okay, I didn’t hear that."
"Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’tso she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good."
"Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian! (Givesher a thumbs up)"
"(Entering before Joey can say anything) Good afternoon,are you the decision maker of the house?"
"Uhhhh. (He’s not sure)"
"Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?"
"No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything inthere."
"Actually, I’m not buying. I’m selling. Let meask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along eventhough you’re not really sure what they’re talking about?"
"Oh yeah, I totally agree."
"…I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nod‘Yes.’)"
"Nooo!! (Joey quickly stops nodding his head.)"
"…it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh,but Joey only laughs not to be left out.)"
"(Interrupting the flashback) Excuse me, I’m sorry,you haven’t said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at allinterested?"
"Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in."
"That’s weird."
"What?"
"Your nails."
"Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Momwouldn’t give me grief about me biting them."
"Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have ninenow."
"(Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had themput… (realises) Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!"
"Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store,I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’regonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, it’s ‘causethey’re gonna eat—that’s the problem."
"(entering) (to Monica) Honey, don’t bite your nails."
"Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah,there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to knowwhich one."
"And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!"
"(laughs) I’m not freaking out."
"Then why are you laughing?"
"It’s nothing, it’s just that now your Fatherowes me five dollars."
"What? You bet I’d lose a nail?"
"Oh no, don’t be silly. I just bet I’d needthese. (Opens the freezer to reveal…)"
"Frozen lasagnas?"
"Um-hmm."
"You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff abouthiring me because I was good was…"
"Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you’venever been able to laugh at yourself."
"(laughs) That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faithin me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha."
"I don’t get it."
"No, I have faith…"
"(interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and anawkward silence follows.)"
"Ding!"
"Op, the ruined quiches are ready."
"It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up."
"No, we are. I’m sad."
"Okay."
"(answering the phone) Yes. (listens) Uh, can’t you waituntil tomorrow? (listens) All right. (hangs up) Unbelievable!!"
"Thanks."
"No, no, that was my boss. I have to go."
"Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)"
"What are you doing?"
"Why?"
"When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me."
"Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me. (She kisses him)Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy."
"(kisses him) I’ll be back in ten minutes. (Starts toleave)"
"You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?"
"Knowing you’re here, waiting for me I think it’skinda exciting."
"Okay. But if you don’t come back soon, (She leaves andcloses the door) there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!"
"(locking her door) Oh."
"Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!"
"Oh great! I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose. (Shegrabs the cookie and walks out.)"
"That’s weird, she locked the door."
"Y’know why? She’s got the Christmas bonus list inthere. I saw her working on it this morning."
"Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave mea key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?"
"Yeah!"
"Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?"
"Hello, Joanna…(Realises he doesn’t know her lastname)…’s office."
"(on speaker phone) I’m really sorry but I may be a littlewhile longer."
"How little?!"
"A couple of hours, I feel awful."
"Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!"
"I can’t!!"
"Why not?!"
"I’m in my boss’s car!"
"What?!"
"Uh-oh, tunnel. (The phone gets cut off)"
"(answering it) (angrily) What?!"
"(in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see youfor a moment?"
"Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs areon the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlockme? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit."
"You"
"I did break up with her! She just took it really, reallywell!"
"And the fact that you were jeopardising my career neverentered your mind?!"
"It did enter my mind! But then something happened that madeit, shoot right out."
"Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, youget yourself out of them."
"No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out ofthem! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlockme, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on astatue behind Joanna’s desk.)"
"Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) Younever see Joanna again!"
"Never!"
"You never come into this office again!"
"Fine!"
"You give me back my Walkman!"
"I—never borrowed your Walkman."
"Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!"
"You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goesover and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)"
"Does it hurt?"
"No, I just always see guys doing this when they gethandcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!"
"Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?"
"About what?"
"When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna knowthat I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!"
"I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, Iactually did borrow your Walkman!"
"No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna knowthat I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were!(She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)"
"Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!"
"Well, this is much better."
"So, here’s somebody interesting, Joey. What do youknow about Van Gogh?"
"He cut off his ear."
"And?"
"I’m out."
"He painted that. (Points to one of his paintings in thebook)"
"Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?"
"Let’s see, ahhh… Where does the Pope live?"
"In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer."
"Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you knowabout vulcanised rubber?"
"Spock’s birth control."
"(laughs) You"
"Hey!"
"Hi."
"This used to be your room? (She nods ‘Yes’) Wow! Youmust’ve been in really good shape as a kid."
"Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actuallythought she could change."
"Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica."
"Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on."
"No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change whatit means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hiredto do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica."
"What?"
"Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents wouldsay, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go,"Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcersays, "Yeah, that one’s outta here." Though some things don’t change."
"(getting up) All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’mnot gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make."
"Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joinsMonica.)"
"Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up backthe way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office.Now I know why."
"Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If shecomes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you werein here. So you might as well just let me go."
"What if I clean your bathroom for a month?"
"It still wouldn’t be clean. (Rachel makes an ‘Eww,disgusting!’ face) All I want is my freedom."
"Foot rubs for a month!"
"Freedom!"
"I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photoalbums!"
"Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?!(Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)"
"Sophie sit!!"
"No! God, would you just calm down!"
"I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you pleasejust… (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head,which proves his point.)"
"Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit. (Theduck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duckgoes back into the bathroom.)"
"So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set ofencyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!"
"Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home inthe middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s afew things you don’t get from book learnin’."
"Well ah, what can you swing?"
"How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?"
"You don’t have, anything?"
"You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets)Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and anarmy man. Hey!"
"Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.(Starts to leave)"
"And a 50. (The salesman stops suddenly) Huh, these must beChandler’s pants."
"For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A?B? C?"
"Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see howthis bad boy turns out."
"I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts."
"No!"
"I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice everymorning!"
"With extra pulp?"
"(happily) Yeah!!"
"No!"
"D’oh!! (pause) I’ve got it!"
"You don’t have it."
"I have"
"How do Monica and Phoebe know?"
"Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can bevery generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy."
"(intrigued) Go on."
"I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’sMilton Berle."
"And Milton Berle has a…"
"Ohh, not compared to you. (Chandler nods in agreement)"
"Well?"
"They’re not even touching the lasagna!"
"Really?!"
"Oh, they love your casserole."
"Yes!!"
"It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago thiswas nothing but ingredients."
"(entering) Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish."
"And you?"
"I thought it was… quite tasty."
"So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would makethis a success. Which would make you…"
"(interrupting) A bitch?"
"Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word."
"Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you reallyimpressed me today."
"Wow!"
"Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They bothlook at her) (to Monica) She doesn’t know we switched it. (Monica nods her head‘No.’)"
"And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothingbut ice in the freezer. (She starts to bite her nails)"
"That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite yournails."
"(hello) Hello."
"Hey!"
"(in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile onher face.)"
"(to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)"
"Wh-what’s going on?"
"Oh."
"No he doesn’t!"
"(checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!"
"So did you break up with Joanna?"
"I think so."
"Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before sheblew up like that Vesuvius."
"The volcano?"
"Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneousrock formation."
"What?!"
"Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant."
"Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?"
"Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talkabout? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?"
"Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?(Joey is pissed)"
"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
"Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country."
"With such a sad history."
"Could there"
"(from her office) Who’s out there?"
"It’s me! Good morning!"
"Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?"
"Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, soI… (Enters Joanna’s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothingbut a slip) Oh my word!"
"I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you pleaseget the key off the back of the door for me."
"Oh, yeah! Yeah!"
"You tell your friend Chandler that we’re"
"Okay."
