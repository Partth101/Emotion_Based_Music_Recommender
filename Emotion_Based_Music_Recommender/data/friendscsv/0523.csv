"Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked."
"No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time."
"Naked alone time."
"No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk aroundnaked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked."
"Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?"
"So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip toLondon?"
"So it's pretty much the same Pheebs."
"Okay, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each onefrom her purse.)"
"Yeah, I guess it's a little better now."
"Ah-ha! Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be rightback. (Gets up and heads aft.)"

"Oh no. [The patented version.]"
"What Richard thing?"
"(To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!"
"Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted togo for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get madand I didn't want to spoil our anniversary."
"(talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad."
"Really?!"
"Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite!It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)"
"Great!"
"Okay, London 1…"

"Monica had lunch with Richard."
"Dawson?!"
"Noo! But that would've been so cool!"
"No! Her boyfriend Richard!"

"Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building."
"Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass thateasily."
"What?! You totally get embarrassed!"
"No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are."
"Is that so?"
"Yeah."
"(loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much youwant it! Okay?! I am"
"Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat."
"Really?"

"What the? What…"
"(to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only secondsafter Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn'treal, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pantswould be dry.) Hi!"
"Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems tohave had a little accident."

"What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It wasincredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking atmy hands in a mirror!"
"Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?"
"Don’t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie.I'm gonna be a millionaire!"
"(totally confused) How?"
"Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money!Come on! Identical hands!"
"Again I must go back to, how?"
"This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how muchwould you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice? Huh?"

"That was Joey!"
"I wonder where she is. That is so weird."
"Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard."
"Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when shecame back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!"
"Really?"
"Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gottafind her."
