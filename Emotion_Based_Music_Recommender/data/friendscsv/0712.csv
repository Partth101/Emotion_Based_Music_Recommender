"(looking up) Ross, when’s this comet thing start?"
"Well, technically it seven"
"(groaning) Oh no! Oh no! (They all start to get up a leave.)"
"Okay! Okay! Fine, I’ll stop! No teaching, okay? We’ll just watchthe pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets don’t streak across the sky,meteors do.) Okay? Who’s official name is Bapstein-King."
"Okay! Okay! (They start to leave again.)"
"(looking up) There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn’t Mother Natureamazing?"
"(looking up with her) That’s a plane!"
"Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that’spretty amazing too."
"Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here."
"No. No, you can’t."
"What?"
"Oh I don’t-I don’t know."
"Man, look at all those stars! (Yeah, you can see what? Five of them fromthe city?) Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn’t it?"
"(looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) Y’know whatelse makes you wonder?"
"Huh?"
"Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Rossand finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes andstarts looking for the comet.)"
"Okay, we’ve been out here for two hours and we haven’t seenany stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler’s getting chilly. (She walks overto where Chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)"
"(with a quivering voice) No, I’m not!"
"Then why are you wearing Monica’s jacket?"
"Because it’s flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come onMonica! (He goes inside.)"
"Yeah actually, I think we’re gonna take off too. We rented a movie."
"Oh! I won’t say, ‘no’ to a movie!"
"Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone."
"Shh! Get me out of here."
"Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)"
"(whispering) Ross!"
"What?"
"Come here, check this out!"
"What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joey’s standing.)"
"No! No-no. Look, there’s a bug stuck in tar right here. (Bends downto get a closer look.)"
"Joey come—I can’t believe—I bring you here to see theBapstein-King comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you careabout are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!"
"(standing up) Y’know, there’s"
"Show me where?"
"Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)"
"(noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey where’s the pipethat was holding the door open?"
"(annoyed) I don’t know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.)(Pause) Yeah, I do."
"Joey!"
"What?! All right—Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one whowanted to come up and look for some stupid"
"It’s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? (Joey starts to groan.)Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!"
"(covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on thedoor.)"
"(whispering) Monica!"
"She’s sleeping."
"I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was"
""
"Sorry, I just…can’t sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light andMonica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who wereice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time Ilook at that cover I’m like…(Fake snores.)"
"It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one willkick you in the shin."
"What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed andheads into the living room.)"
"(crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please don’t be a spaceship. Please don’t be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around andfinds that it’s the smoke detector that’s beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves achair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration sheyanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed, just as she getsthere it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.)How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can…"
"Don’t interrupt me!!"
"Rachel!! Monica!!"
"Come on!"
"I can’t believe this!!"
"All right well, y’know…I guess we know what we have to do to getdown."
"(standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah, I guess we don’t have achoice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roofand we can’t get down!!!"
"Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points itout.)"
"(To Joey) I know, I wasn’t finished. (Joey motions him to finish.)(Yelling at the street) But don’t worry! We’re gonna go down the fire escape!!"
"Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) I’m sorry, I thought maybe I’dmake some warm milk and it would help me sleep."
"With a wok? (Chandler’s holding a wok.) I thought you were going toread my boring book to put you asleep."
"It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!"
"Here, let me make the milk, I’m up anyway."
"Hey, y’know what we can do? Y’know, now that we are up? Wecan just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we werefirst going out. It’d be fun!"
"Okay that does sound like fun."
"Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?"
"The second sister dies?!"
"(Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading."
"The second sister dies in"
"That’s correct."
"You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable."
"Sure."
"Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm, did you sendthose contracts to Milan?"
"If this is your idea of sexy talk? (Shakes his head that it’s notworking.)"
"No seriously, y’know the contracts I gave you, did you overnightthem?"
"What contracts?"
"Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do thatI don’t get."
"Like what?"
"Y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (Hestarts laughing.) Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutelyhad to go out today!"
"Rach, I’m sorry, but you didn’t give me any contracts!"
"Yes I did! And I put a little"
"I’m telling you, you never gave them to me."
"Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see thosecontracts sitting on your desk."
"No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are"
"Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking onthe phone with your crotch!"
"You wanna go down to the office right now?"
"No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office."
"Okay I understand. (Sits down.) I wouldn’t want to be proved wrongeither."
"Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachelsuddenly stops and sticks the hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhookthis? (Her bra.) Nice work!"
"All right, it won’t go down any further. It’s stuck."
"Ugh. Well, we’re just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah.Now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay?Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownishred stuff in the middle. So, when"
"Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!"
"Yeah! Oh yeah, you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh, just like bungyjumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t."
"What if I smack my head on the concrete?"
"Well, I’m gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility."
"(looks at the ground and at Ross) I don’t know Ross! I-I tell youwhat, let’s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?"
"Oh, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of thelanding above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?"
"No."
"Okay. Well, you be careful."
"What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I’m not jumping! Okay, look I have anaudition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg."
"Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a fatherif-if I die!"
"Well all right so, it looks like we’re even!"
"Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here.(She points at each as she says it.) Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have todo… (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets upand heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping hasstopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entranceto the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smokedetector.) (Yelling.)"
"Okay, here’s your milk. What do you want to talk about? (She seesthat Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)"
"(startled) What? What? What?"
"Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I’m sorry. Here. (Hands themug of milk to him.)"
"Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are noton this desk."
"Oh"
"It’s my sister."
"Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the"
"So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in theafternoon?"
"In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He putthem on my desk, and then I put a"
"It’s not here."
"Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room,maybe you left the contracts in there?"
"How could I have left them in the copy room?"
"I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay?It’s not a perfect world! Just go please."
"Fine."
"Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottomdrawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up thephone.) I still don’t get it."
"Are you still awake?"
"Yeah! You?"
"You do know that was me who just said that right? (He doesn’trespond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. As long as we’re both up…"
"(intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope you’re not thinkingabout cleaning the living room."
"Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Doyou want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!"
"(looking in the window behind them) Y’know, y’know I’mlookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break thewindow, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later."
"Yeah? Really? No one’s home?"
"I don’t think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass, which angers the big,large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of thelanding.) When you get in there… (Joey nods his disapproval.)"
"Okay, this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into thechute.) Noisy bitch!"
"What?! What are you doing?!"
"Do you know what just happened?"
"Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep."
"No. We were in the middle of sex…and"
"Nooo! No, that’s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked meworld! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)"
"(turning the light back on) Monica?"
"What?!"
"I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So pleasewake up so"
"Okay. Okay, I’m ready. Come on big fella!"
"Okay."
"Give me the good stuff."
"Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Don’t fall asleep! Okay,I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesn’t move as he gets out of bed and ashe’s heading for the door.) And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all overthe kitchen floor."
"Okay, I’m up! I’m up!"
"Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh… (She looks for a place to set iton his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) …fair enough. So! Doyou got anything for me?"
"Still no luck."
"Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check"
"Do you want me to check again?"
"Well yeah, I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, noit’s not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom oneand he opens it. She doesn’t see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)"
"Well, it’s not out here. Is there any chance it could be in youroffice?"
"(thinks) Y’know, I don’t-I don’t know. Let me, let mecheck. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her should at Tag, looks intoher office, and finds the folder on her desk.)"
"(smirking) Any luck?"
"Can I see you in my office for a minute?"
"(entering) Yeah? (She holds up the folder) You found them!! (Rachel is notamused, because she’s still going to try to blame him for her mistake like every‘good’ boss.) Y’know what? I’m not even going to gloat. I’m justreally relived this whole thing is over."
"You put these on my desk!"
"I did not!"
"Oh really? So you’re saying they just"
"How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?"
"(pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) Iam so hot for you right now."
"Oh my God! How did you get back here?!"
"(scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding theblanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officer—fireman, can-can I help you?"
"We found your fire alarm in the trash chute."
"That’s not mine."
"Yes it is."
"How do you know?"
"The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute,don’t wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay notMonica.""
"Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the lasttime I checked this was still America!"
"Please reattach this, it’s against the law to disconnect them."
"Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop themfrom going off!"
"There’s a reset button under the plastic cover."
"There’s a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! (He exits andshe goes to shut it off.) There’s a reset button! My God! Why didn’t I see that!(She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button,where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.)Oh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached tothe detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh,God!"
"Okay, do-do you have a good grip?"
"Yeah!"
"Okay, I’m going to start climb down you now."
"All right! Just hurry up!"
"Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face toface or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face."
"I think face to face."
"I would say that."
"Face to face, yeah!"
"Okay, here I go."
"All right."
"(grunting) Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!"
"I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a littleholiday weight."
"Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think wethought it all the way through."
"So what do you want me to do?"
"Well, just shimmy down me and drop!"
"Hi."
"Hi."
"(looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me."
"(angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!"
"It’s still looks pretty far!"
"It’s not that far! Just drop!"
"Do not"
"Ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down andI’m not wearing any underwear!"
"Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it whenI—Ooh, a quarter!"
"That really was some of your best work."
"Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I can’t believe thatI’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work."
"I have to be up in seven minutes."
"Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have sevenminutes…"
"Really?!"
"Do you wanna?"
"Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!"
