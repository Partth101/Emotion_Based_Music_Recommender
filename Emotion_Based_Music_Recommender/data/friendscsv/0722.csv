"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys?Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin."
"Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let"
"Yeah, well he’s my brother! And plus he drives so slow he couldnever hurt it."
"It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!"
"Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights afteryou’re done."
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin’ good. When do I get to takethat baby out again?"
"(shocked) You let Joey drive it?!"
"I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive itall the time."
"Nice work everybody! So much for the y’know, "You can driveit, but don’t tell Rachel" plan!"
"Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me."
"Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk aboutis the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)"
"Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive thePorsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about thewedding."
"Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be gladto take you for a quick spin around the block."
"Yeah, you got a couple hours?"
"Whew! That was a brisk ride!"
"Take the top down did ya?"
"Only way to fly."
"Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does"
"You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver."
"Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader."
"Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen mecruising in the bad boy."
"I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross."
"What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush."
"Gimme the keys!"
"No way!"
"Well no brush!"
"Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter, because, if I remembercorrectly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom."
"(to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.)"
"Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad."
"Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him aninvitation."
"Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding."
"I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. Ihaven’t seen him in years."
"Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!"
"Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in thesame circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas."
"Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles."
"Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonnabe staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress."
"So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil Idon’t care."
"Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)"
"Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh, nice!"
"My God!"
"What do you think you’re doing?!"
"Just washing the windshield. (She turns on the wipers forcing Ross offof the hood.)"
"There is"
"Oh."
"No ah-ah-ah! Do"
"Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!"
"With you?! Yeah right!"
"All right. (She starts off.)"
"(grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)"
"What are you doing?! Get in the front!"
"In the death seat?!!"
"Oh my…"
"Hey guys!"
"Hey!"
"Hey sweetie!"
"Ready to go?"
"Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica’s. I’ll be rightback. (She goes to get it.)"
"(stopping her) Wait a minute!"
"What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh.(Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)"
"So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?"
"Over a month."
"Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a littlebetter."
"Sure, I’d like that."
"So uh, what’s your name?"
"(laughs) Its Jake."
"Joey. (They shake hands.) Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?"
"Yeah, big fan."
"Me too! There’s a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?"
"Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I’m not doing anythingTuesday. (He bends over to open his bag, when he does so his pants slide down his buttrevealing a pink lace secret.)"
"Here! (She sets a bag down in front of him.)"
"What’s this?"
"It’s your suitcase. We’re going to Las Vegas."
"Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?!No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’llsave!! (Monica just looks at him.) We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can ourwedding be bigger please?"
"We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you twotalked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law."
"Y’know we already went over this and I won!"
"No you didn’t. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you’remarrying me, you don’t get to win anymore."
"Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to seehim. I don’t wanna."
"Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…"
"No-no"
"Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he wasthere cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad."
"He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!"
"Who’s Mr. Girabaldi?"
"Does it matter?!"
"Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s timethat you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’regonna regret it for the rest of your life."
"Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you."
"Yes!"
"So I really never get to win anymore?"
"How much did ever really win before?"
"Pheebs!"
"Hey!"
"Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you leanforward I check out your underwear?"
"Yeah!"
"Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’sunderwear!"
"I know. They were mine."
"Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, that’s weird!"
"No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to trythem on."
"That’s weird!"
"I’m wearing his briefs right now."
"That’s…kinda hot."
"I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick."
"Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that."
"And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actuallymore comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin."
"Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your highheels are good for his posture!"
"There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinkingeven more than you."
"Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys."
"I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with hismasculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could everdo that."
"Hey! I"
"Okay whatever."
"You’ve seen my huge stack of porn right? (Phoebe nods.)"
"God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have"
"(shocked) You don’t have a"
"Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need torelax all right? Just need to relax… (She takes her hands off of the wheel.)"
"(grabbing the wheel) What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okaythat’s not funny! Just stop horsing around!"
"I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around."
"Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.)"
"Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in thatmuch trouble."
"Really? You think so?"
"I was talking to myself! You’re going down!"
"(to Chandler and Monica) Has someone taken your order yet?"
"Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did. (To Chandler) She? (To the waiter)I’m-I’m sorry I’m new. I don’t…"
"(To Chandler) Hm-mmm?"
"Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)"
"You’re straight. I get it. (Walks away.)"
"I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten betterseats."
"No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re yet! I’m notsure I’m ready for that. And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see meeither."
"Why not?!"
"I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kindatried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years"
"What?!"
"Yeah, he’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to NewYork, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very"
