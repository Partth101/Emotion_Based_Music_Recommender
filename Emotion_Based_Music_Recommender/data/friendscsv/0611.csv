"We didn’t give you any money! (Chandler is motioning,"No!")"
"You don’t think I know that!"
"…see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the newwicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table."
"Wow! I didn’t know that there was a"

"A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that!The ornamental bird cage! Large!"

"Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, y’know what? Since you have such a greatsense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you takePhoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff."
"(not sure of what to do) Y’know what? I don’t, I don’tthink Phoebe really wants to come."
"No! I do want to!"
"Oh, she does want to."
"She does want to."
"Yeah!"
"Pheebs, I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was justbetter last time."
"Well at least I got these sheets for Ross."
"Yeah."
"Uck, look at this!"
"Yeah, y’know what? Don’t look at it. (Realizes the display istheir living room) Seriously, don’t look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)"
"No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!"
"Ugh, those bastards! Let’s go."
"That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait asec! This is our exact living room!"
"No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours istotally different! I mean we don’t have the… (Looks desperately for somethingdifferent.) We don’t have the…that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know, onthe other side."
"Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff,"
"Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I knowhow you feel about"
"No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything thatis wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I canthink about is how I don’t have that lamp!"
"Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross."
"I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-thatyou would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?"
"What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!"
"But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy thatlamp?"
"(gets it) Oh. Yes! I would"
"Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!"
"That’s right!"
"But at least the apothecary table is real."
"Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?"
"Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I’ve got to say, I’msorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervousor something."
"That’s totally understandable."
"Don’t worry about it."
"So we can go out again?"
"Oh yeah!"
"Absolutely!"
"Oh good."
"Oh well then, good night!"
"Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)"
"See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?"
"We have"
"(bursting in) I"
"And I’m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watchingmodern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) "Oh Chandler,I just lost myself in the moment.""
"Y’know, I know you’re talking, but all I hear is, "Blah.Blah. Blah-blah-blah.""
"(steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Let’s go! Rightnow!"
"All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler andMonica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)"
"(To Monica) Y’know I think you can take her."
"(to Janine) You’d better hope I don’t see you in the hallway!!(They exit.)"
"All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These peopleare my friends; you can’t treat them that way."
"They said stuff to me too, y’know!"
"I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean somuch to me. They… They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting allthe time, I-I… I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’twork. It can’t. (Starts to break up) I’m very upset."
"Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?"
"Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for herand she exits into the hallway.)"
"What did I tell you about the hall?!"
"I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I’dreally like it if we could be friends."
"Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too."
"Great."
"Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, I’m glad we worked thingsout."
"Me too."
"Okay."
"I’ll see you."
"Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)"
"(muttering to herself) Or I’ll hear you."
"(hearing that) That’s it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt withthe garbage bag) Come on!"
"Wait! (Janine pauses, then runs down the stairs.)"
"(chasing her) You’d better run!"
"Did you hear that?"
"Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?"
"Yeah, I’m sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?"
"Yeah! (They head downstairs.)"
"Hey!"
"How ya doin’?"
"Hey so, did uh, did she move out?"
"Pretty much, yeah."
"I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that."
"Well, when it’s not right, you know it."
"You okay?"
"Yeah! Yeah. I’ll be all right."
"Y’know what would cheer you up?"
"What?"
