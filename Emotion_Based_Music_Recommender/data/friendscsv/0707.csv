"Yeah—Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And heylisten, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’mnot looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great."
"Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!"
"Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh,I’m a loner—No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up withthe likes of me."

"Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used todo it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave‘em for me."
"Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not myresponsibility."

"Hi."
"Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in."

"My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it,and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontologysection!"
"Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?"
"Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place oncampus where students went to uh, fool around."
"Yeah, there was. It was—there the corner of the library where-whereall these dusty books that nobody ever read—Yes, there was."
"Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing!"

"No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarianbrings his boss over.)"
"How can I help you?"
"Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in thePaleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it peopleare-are-are well, rolling around in front of it."
"We are aware of the problem you are referring too. (He turnsto look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, I’m afraid thelibrary is very understaffed. I, I can’t help you."
"Well, fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation ofthe sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts todo so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And don’t you follow me!"
"Hey."
"Hey!"
"How did it go with Erin?"
"Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!"
"Yay!! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore?"
"No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than thefirst time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous."
"Didn’t you sleep together?"
"Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She lovessandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were everto have kids, well that’s a…"

"Is that all?"
"I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t youtell about your lovely wedding?"
"Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about thewedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even surewhy we’re having it."

"No spark? Didn’t you sleep together?"
"Yeah."
"Ugh, tramp!"
"Does Joey have any idea?"
"I really don’t think he does. And y’know what? Maybe you guyscould help clue him in. Y’know, tell him I’m-I’m not interested in aserious relationship or something."
"Yeah, you mean like that you’re kind of a loner."
"Yeah! That would be great!"
"Yeah, and maybe that you’re a real (She says something in Italian,and it doesn’t matter what she said. It’s not important so I don’t needeveryone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)"
"I’m sorry?"

"(returning) Hey! You wanna go?"
"Yeah, let’s go."
"Okay. See you guys later."
"Bye guys."
"Yeah, see ya."
"(whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)"
"Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here."
"No, just a regular old flying dwarf."
"Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?"
"Yeah, we were…we were just looking around."
"Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were youlooking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. ChesterStock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?"
"Uhh…."

"Well I uh, I skipped forth grade."
"I am very…very sorry."
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hi!"
"So how was, how was your date?"
"Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to thisice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still… And guess what, I’mthinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts."
"Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?"
"No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be trickythought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while."
"Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got thefeeling from her today that uh, she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship."
"Where are you gettin’ this?"
"Well, she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner."
"Oh. Oh."
"Joey…"
"No hey Rach, it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too! (Headsfor his room.) Right?"
"Hey Joey, y’know what? You are way to good for her."
"Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye andtell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship."
"No! No. Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me."
"Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?"
"Yeah?"
"Do you want some pancakes?"
"(coming back out) Finally!"
"What are we gonna do?"
"I say we go with"
"Chandler?"
"(To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?"
"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?"
"Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then Ijust felt I couldn’t really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open doorbehind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I waswondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be withfamily."
"(To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?"
"Please, it’s because otherwise I really don’t know what Imight do."
"Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?"
"(starting to cry) Do you have any tissues?"
"Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom."
"Okay! (She runs for the bathroom)"
"We’ll just…we’ll just let her stay."
"No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay"
"Kinda like your Barca lounger."
"Is that what you’re thinking about right now?"
"I"
"Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before Itake my bath."
"Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight."
"Why not?"
"Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. NowMonica and I have been immunized, but sadly"
"Okay, I’m going to need a comforter, but did you have ahypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do youhave a cat? ‘Cause it’s already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hearthat? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)"
"Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!"
"Why?"
"Because Chandler still has feelings for you!"
"He does?"
"Say again?"
"That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’tstay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding."
"Feelings, such strong feelings."
"I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but"
"Oh…my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I’ll go. (Startsfor the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)"
"(to the guard) Don’t sweat it, I’ve got this section covered.Yeah, in fact I’ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine inpeople’s eye—(The guard walks away)—Okay, see you later."
"I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)"
