"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Never mind. But it was going to be really good."
"What's going on?"
"What is it?"
"So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Alcalls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
"That's great!"
"So.... I quit."
"Why?"
"Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!"
"Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years."
"If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what Iactually do."
"So was it a lot more money?"
"It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's inhis office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS."
"... the WENUS?"
"Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term."
"(sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS."
"So what're you going to do?"
"I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I justknow I'm not going to figure it out working there."

"(taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there."
"Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know.You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs ajob right now, so...."
"Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it'san all-toast restaurant."
"(to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah!"
"Well, what kind of food is he looking for?"
"Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone whocan, you know, create the entire menu."
"(excited) Oh my God!"
"Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?"
"Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
"OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!"
"Can you see my nipples through this shirt?"
"No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there."
"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, careercounselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the "a-gogo.""
"Career counselor?"
"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do."
"I don't!"
"Hey, you guys"
"Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech."
"Oh, I love my life, I love my life!"
"Ooh!"
"The meeting with the guy went great?"
"So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this,it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right."
"Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?"
"So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind oflike an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for mebecause then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises."
"What are you going to make?"
"(as though Rachel wasn't paying attention) Yummy noises."
"(pause) And Monica, what are"
"I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!"
"Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel inthe kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with thestuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.(sits down)"
"Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?"
"How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?"
"Who are you going out with?"
"Oh, is this the bug lady?"
"(trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross."
"Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at themuseum."
"So what are you guys going to do?"
"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring herback to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey."
"And he's"
"(aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...(gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?"
"Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures)huh-huh."
"I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take onelook at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal."
"Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you!Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel..."
"I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my..."
"Alright... (lifts Marcel away)"
"(to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse."
"(tasting) Mmmm. Good."
"Is it better than the other salmon mousse?"
"It's creamier."
"Yeah, well, is that"
"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'mkeeping it down, y'know?"
"My God! What happened to you?"
"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests,personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) "Youare ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinationalcorporation.""
"That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!"
"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should bedoing something really"
"(comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh,hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!"
"(brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'llcheer you up."
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better splitthis with you."
"It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call itan"
"(tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing..."
"(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock.(Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) Allright, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)"
"Ten dollars an hour for what?"
"Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out."
"(hurt) Waitressing?"
"Uh-oh."
"Well... of course I thought of you! But... but..."
"But, but?"
"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know?And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
"Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that Ican waitress in the Olympics."
"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in'76. (dead silence)"
"Talk to me."
"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."
"No no no. Talk... dirty."
"(embarrassed) Wha... what, here?"
"Yes..."
"Ah...."
"Say something....."
"(panicked) Er.... um....."
"What?"
"Um... uh.... vulva."
"(in disbelief)"
"Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but itwasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling."
"(sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??"
"Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kindof guy, you know?"
"What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what youwant her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'lltell you what. Just try something on me."
"(deadpan) Please be kidding."
"Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd liketo be doing right now."
"OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment..."

"I... ahem... I really don't think so."
"Come on! You like this woman, right?"
"Yeah."
"You want to see her again, right?"
"Sure."
"Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her?Now tell me you want to caress my butt!"
"OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring atme when I'm doing this."
"(turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead."
"Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with mylips."
"There you go! Keep going. Keep going!"
"I, er..."
"I want to take my tongue... and..."

"And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (handsphone to Chandler) And again."
"(on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?(Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pensfrom your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look,this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something Ican really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure youmentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This isnot a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'mtelling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you onMonday! (slams the phone down)"
"Well?"
"(excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, thisis a cube."
"Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)"
"Oh! You have a window!"
"Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of..."
"Oh look! That guy's peeing!"
"(walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check thisout, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
"(sitting) OK."
"This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could youcome in here for a moment?"
"Thank you Helen, that'll be all."
"Last time I do that, I promise."
"(shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised!Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)"
"Who was that?"
"Wendy bailed. I have no waitress."
"Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. (she walks away towards the door)"
"Ten dollars an hour."
"No."
"Twelve dollars an hour."
"Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around."
"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you.I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it,desperate) twenty dollars an hour."
"Done."
"Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?"
"Hi Steve!"
"Hello, Monica. (to Rachel) Hello, greeter girl."
"(to Steve) This is Rachel."
"(unconcerned) Yeah, OK."
"(overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, Ican't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop)of, OK, smells."
"It's a lovely apartment."
"Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?"
"I was just being polite, but, alright."
"What's up?"
"(whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie."
"What?"
"Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?"
"OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK."
"(from the living room) Is it dry in here? (licks his lips)"
"Let me, let me get you some wine!"
"Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monicabrings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce...(Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (hefinishes)... ginger."
"Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!"
"I'm so glad you liked them!"
"Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!"
"Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and ahalf minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets."
"Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. (he gets upand goes into the kitchen)"
"Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?"
"You know, I don't know what I'm looking for."
"(from kitchen) Ah, cool! Taco shells! (Rachel motions, "Yousee!") You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope."
"(joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't wantto spoil your appetite."
"(looking in cabinets) Hey! Sugar-O's! (grabs the cereal box)"
"You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes..."
"Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!"
"No, we don't. (reaches for box)"
"Oh, OK. (he drops the box on the floor) Oh, sorry. (When she bends downto pick it up he grabs a package of Gummi-bears from the cabinet.)"
"Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then triesto secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears."
"(childishly) No."
"Give them to me."
"Alright, we'll share."
"No, give me the..."
"Well then you can't have any. (she grabs for the package, and it breaksopen. Gummi-bears fly everywhere, some into the punch bowl on the table.) Bear overboard!I think he's drowning. (he throws some Sugar-O's into the punch bowl) Hey fellows! Grab ona Sugar-O... save yourself! (Mimicking the bears) "Help!  I'm drowning!  Help!""
"(furious) That's it! Dinner is over!"
"What?"
""
"Why?"
"Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity likethis, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?"
"(excited) Hey!"
"What a tool!"
"You don't want to work for a guy like that."
"Yeah!"
"I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it."
"Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef."
"Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking."
"(to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?"
"Oh, I was unbelievable."
"All right, Ross!"
"I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filthyou have"
"Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?"
"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk,it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
"You cuddled."
"Yeah, which was nice."
"You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?"
"Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?"
"Yeah, where the hell is he?"
"(on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at theWENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell yousomething... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slamsphone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa...."
"How's this? (presses down hard)"
"Eeeee!"
"Sorry. How about over here? (presses down hard again)"
"Aaaaah!"
"See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? (presses downelsewhere)"
"No."
"What about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells inpain)"
"Aaaaahhh!!"
"There you go! (She continues to work him overwith her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)"
