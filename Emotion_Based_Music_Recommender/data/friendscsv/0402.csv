"Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having sex withAmy Welch!"
"Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?"
"I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!"
"Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
"Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same highschool."
"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride offChip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a banduniform they had to have specially made."
"(shocked) They had to have that specially made?!"
"It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes."
"(stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!"
"Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go outwith a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And thefat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat."
"Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her)"
"Oh, really?!"
"Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and gohave sex with another guy?"
"I’ll try."
"So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?"

"So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?"
"Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used tothe fact that there’s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she’s worried thaty'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice)Well, that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call inthe other room."
"Why can’t you use the phone in here?"
"Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. Ijust spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica’s room)"
"So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a"
"Ross, don’t start."
"Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-thatthere’s a woman inside that cat!"
"I believe it."
"No you don’t."
"Yes, I do."
"No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this."
"Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right."
