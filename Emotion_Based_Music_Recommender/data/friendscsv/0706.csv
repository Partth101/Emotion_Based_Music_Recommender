"Yes!!! Oh!!"
"Hypothetically!"
"Still."
"If Phoebe were my maid of honor…"
"Uh-hmm."
"Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we allget to do it once and no one would get upset."

"So uh, what did this woman look like?"
"She was like 30, dark hair, attractive."
"Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thingcalled a mirror?"
"Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?"

"Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she stillfeel bad?"
"Well, apparently she does."

"Hey! What’s going on?"
"Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!"
"Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for thatgirl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)"
"(shocked)"
"See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!"
"All right that’s it!"
"Na-uh,"
"How come you are?!"
"Because I cared enough to lie!"
"Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we couldhave like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor typesituations."
"What are you talking about?"
"Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best ofthe people they see, they give me the part."
"Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?"
"Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges."
"(To Rachel) Well, it’s better than us deciding."
"Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!"
"No! Coins hate me!"
"Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.(Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie."
"Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)"
"Wow, this cologne really"
"Hi."
"Just uh, brought back your videos."
"Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before."
"No! No we don’t!"
"Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!"
"I… I don’t know what you are talking about."
"Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!"
"I’ve had better."
"Okay! When?!"
"All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!"
"Uh-huh!"
"I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!"
"I want to do it again."
"We"
"Why not?"
"Because it’s weird!"
"Fine! Do you want something to drink?"
"Sure, what do you got?"
"Warm milk and"
"Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who youare!"
"Can you figure out what I’m doing?"
"You’re Lewis Posin."
"Who?"
"Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one dayI asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?"
"Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to thebathroom?!"
"No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa…. (Chandler emerges,without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad asI did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie."
"What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago."
"No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewisapologized to me."
"Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a betterperson and that is"
"Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonnagive you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to10, 1 being the highest."
"No, 10 is the highest."
"Why is 10 the highest?"
"Because it’s the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachelyou’re up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: You’re withMonica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing thepart of Monica.)"
"(crying) I don’t want to marry Chandler!"
"Okay, uh…"
"I’ve got cold feet."
"…it’s gonna be okay!"
"No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it!This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!"
"Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know,it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to rememberthat you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep thegifts."
"(out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, Ilike that!"
"Thanks!"
"Yes, very nice Rachel."
"Thank you judges."
"Ugh, what a kiss ass."
"Oh!"
"Okay, Phoebe…"
"Yes! Your honor?"
"We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do"when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!"
"(playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I rememberthat—(Phoebe screams and tackles him)—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!"
"Oh!"
"Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!"
"Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!"
"Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!"
"It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech."
"Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…"
"Go!"
"Okay! Okay! Umm,"
"Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately andI’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you aretruly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holdsit up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upontogether. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey."
"Wow. (To Ross) Good speech."
"Yeah, it really was!"
"Aw, thanks!"
"Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next (To Joey) although I reallydon’t see the point."
"Yeah."
"Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.(Raises her glass and drinks.)"
"And she’s back in the game."
"(she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you rememberme."
"Hello Skidmark."
"(To Monica) It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later."
"It’s pretty clear."
"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have brokenup with you because you were overweight."
"That’s why you broke up with me?"
"You-you-you didn’t know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, Iguess my work here is done!"
"All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performedvery well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say thatin this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!"
"Really?! I won!"
"What?!"
"I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close."
"Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where I’ve heard thatbefore.)"
"Actually, it wasn’t that close."
"No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this wasridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips thecoin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)"
"The coins have finally forgiven me!"
"Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her,her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)"
"(running after her) Rach, it’s gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey)You guys are the best!"
"Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me."
"Yeah?"
"Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap onmy couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)"
"Why-why would I care about that?"
"No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’llbe."
"As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’mgoing to apologize for all of the stupid things I do."
"Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’thave to apologize."
"I would really love it if could do both."
"All right, I…I have to ask."
"What?"
"Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?"
"What?!"
"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she havegained?"
"A hundred and forty-five pounds."
"In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s notthe point."
"Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but Iwas 15!"
"Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You rememberwhen umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat."
"Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different."
"How?"
"You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!"
"What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different.I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!"
"Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin,beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologizefor later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica."
"Keep going."
"So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still loveyou."
"Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?"
"I’d carry you around in my pocket."
"I love you. (They hug and kiss.)"
"Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies."
"Hi Pheebs."
"Hi!"
"Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby."
"That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks ather.) Oh, you mean today."
"Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’knowI was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get tobe yours."
"Oh yeah!"
"Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I startedputting some stuff together, y’know just in case…"
"Oh that’s so sweet thanks."
"Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God thisis funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (ShowsPhoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was"
"Ohh."
"And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry atweddings. (Starting to cry.) I’m just gonna grab a couple of these."
"This stuff is great!"
"Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I wassaving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’sblue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah…"
"Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s madeof honor."
"You do? Why?"
"Because I think it means more to you."
"But Pheebs, y’know you earned it."
"Its fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking aboutsince you were what, 14? (She’s referring to the Halloween picture.)"
"No, I was ten. I just developed early."
"(looking at the picture again) Man alive!"
"(entering) Hey, what’s going on?"
"Hey!"
"Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor."
"(gasps) Ohh, wow! That’s great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! Wereally have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We shouldprobably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we’llget together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I’m so excited! (Runs outleaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)"
"Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours. (Phoebe getssuddenly scared.)"
"Great nap."
"It really was."
"(reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!(Heads for his room leaving Ross.)"
"(slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)"
