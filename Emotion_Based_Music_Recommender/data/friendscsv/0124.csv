"Oh, just, y'know.... science."

"So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your(provocatively) special someone?"
"I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great."
"Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?"
"What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?"
"Man's got a point."
"Well, the tough thing is, she"
"Crazy bitch."
"Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according tothe rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonalexperiments, if you know what I mean."

"I'm going to China."
"Jeez, you say one thing, and..."
"You're going to China?"
"Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, butthey don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them togive us the bo—it's—it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone forlike, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's myitinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me... (hands it toMonica)"
"Oh, let me see! (takes the picture)"
"(to Monica): Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show itto Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?"
"Yeah."
"Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picturedown, sees Ross staring at her) Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun."
"Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before Ileft."
"Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl."
"Oh. (pause) Hey, who's Carl?"
"You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse."
"No."
"Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the..."
"At the coffeehouse, right."
"So you"
"OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys."
"Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story."
"Hi."
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"(sigh)....I have to go to China."
"The country?"
"No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys knowwho Carl is?"
"Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no."
"Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight."
"Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?"
""
"He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food."
"Course there, they just call it food."
"Yeah... I guess. I don't—I don't know. Alright, just... just give herthis for me, OK? (gives Chandler a gift for Rachel)"
"Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you."
"I know."
"We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but...I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)"
"I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice."
"Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basketbusiness. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'"
"Like the three musketeers, only with fruit."
"(sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)"
"(gets up) OK, how does everybody like their burgers?"
"Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. (walks into living room)"
"Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?"
"Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we'regonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I..."
"Then you do. Heh, heh."
"So, uh, have you ever thought about being there"
"What do you mean?"
"Y'know, just be there"
"Not following you."
"Think about it."
"OK, I'm guessing this is from..."
"Well, thank you, Melanie."
"(pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me."
"(picks it up) OK... ah, it's light... (shakes it)...it rattles...it's... (opens it)"
"This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feelslike a book. And...(opens it)...it's a book!"
"Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!"
"(to Rachel): That book got me through some tough times."
"There is a little child inside this man!"
"Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die."
"Who's this from?"
"Oh, that's Ross's."
"Oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered."
"Remembered what?"
"It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I sawthis pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I wasa little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"
"Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his"
"Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
"I can't believe he did this."
"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love withCarol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
"What did you just say?"
"(panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck."
"No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?"
"(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin...."
"Oh.... my God."
"(rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no...."
"(pats Chandler on the leg) That's good, just keep rubbing your head.That'll turn back time."
"I mean, this is unbelievable."
"I know. This is really, really huge."
"No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee."
"Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same everagain."
"OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
"I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?"
"No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned somethingabout asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what elsedid he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?"
"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn'tmind getting a cup of coffee or something."
"Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)"
"(quickly) H-He's in China!"
"The country."
"No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave foranother forty-five more minutes."
"What about the time difference?"
"From here to the airport?"
"Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!"
"Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?"
"I-I-I don't know."
"Well then maybe you shouldn't go."
"He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's thekind of thing that can wait."
"Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now."
"I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him."
"Here, look, alright, does this help?"
"Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him.I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta...OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)"
"Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)"
"(something in Chinese)"
"Alright!"
"Ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)"
"Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...."
"Hi."
"May I see your boarding pass?"
"Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend."
"Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unlessyou have a boarding pass."
"No, I know, but I—he just went on. He's right there, he's got theblue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
"No no no! Federal regulations!"
"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him amessage for me? Please? This is"
"Alright. What's the message?"
"Uh... I don't know."
"Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you."
"(confused) What?"
"It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and shewill see you when you get back."
"(to wife): Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talkingabout! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze."
"Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for aminute!"
"Heh, heh. It was nothin'."
"Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! (she starts kissinghis chest)"
"(panicked) Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's giveyou another turn."
"(surprised) M-Me again?"
"Sure! Why not?"
"Boy, somebody's gonna get a"
"Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be."
"How do you mean?"
"I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guyswho're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man Iever met. I mean... you're practically a woman."
"Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean,it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throwit out?"
"I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, andI thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's"
"Sure."
"I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'mthinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great."
"Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what thebest part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it'slike starting on the fifteenth date!"
"Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenthdate."
"Another good point."
"No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you'realready in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed."
"(confused) Huh?"
"Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?"
"Why isn't it working out?"
"I don't know... sometimes it doesn't."
"Is he not cute enough for you?"
"No!"
"Does he not make enough money?"
"No, I'm just...."
"Maybe there's someone else."
"Wha..."
"Is there? Is there someone else?"
"No! There is.. there is noone else!"
"Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?"
"Hey, big..."
"Shhhh!"
"(quietly) ...spender."
"She's still asleep."
"So how'd it go?"
"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"
"The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you knowme."
"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes megreat. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it waslike a ticker tape parade!"
"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the paraderoute."
"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, allof a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I wasable to appreciate it on another level."
"I didn't know you had another level."
"I know! Neither did I!"
"Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?"
"Yeah."
"Oh, from who?"
"From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me."
"Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couplehours? At gate 27-B?"
"Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it andI've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea."
"Oh, why?"
"Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would begoing out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don'twanna..."
"(gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!"
"Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so..."
"I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll begood. I promise."
"Who is it?"
"It's me, Carl."
"C'mon up."
"Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kindof crazy thing you won't be hearing from me."
"Seven hundred bucks!"
"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like Ilearned something."
"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
"What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walkaround like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)"
"I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that"
"I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me."
"Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here."
"Fine, just stop thinking about me."
"Can't do it, can you?"
"So I'm thinking about you. So what?"
"I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?"
"Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy...."
"I mean, come on, buddy, get a"
"Rachel, come on. Give us a chance."
"Ross, it's too hard."
"No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who caresabout them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninthgrade."
"Ross, you're like my best friend."
"I know."
"If we broke up, and I lost you..."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?"
"Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?"
"(pause) No. But... it only has to happen"
"I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before."
"Well, start looking."
"Wow."
"Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind thishammerhead in traffic!"
"Right! You're right!"
"Heh... y'know?"
"You know what?"
"What?"
"I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am sosorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him herdrink) I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry."
"But..."
"(sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me,sorry. Hi."
"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!"
"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
"Oh, thanks, sweetie."
"No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends."
"Really?"
"Yeah."
"You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?"
"No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
"Can't wait."
"Come on, they're gonna love you."
