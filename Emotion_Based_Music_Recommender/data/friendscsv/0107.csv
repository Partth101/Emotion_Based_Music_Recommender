"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind."
"Alright, somebody."
"OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table."
"Whoooaa!"
"That's my sister."
"OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the secondfloor of the New York CIty public library."
"Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?"
"Pheebs, what about you?"
"Oh... Milwaukee."
"Um... Ross?"
"Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'"
"No way!"
"The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of thosemechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to returnto the Magic Kingdom."
"Oh, Rachel."
"Oh come on, I already went."
"You did not go!"
"Come on."
"Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, thefoot of the bed."
"Step back."
"We have a winner!"
"I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know,where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park."
"Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line."
"There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golfcourse."
"Come on."
"No, he said we were holding up the people behind us."
"(sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?"
"I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never havingthat kind of..."
"Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated."
"Yeah right."
"It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you'releft with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So,you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all thatother good stuff."
"(sigh) OK."
"But, um... I don't think that's going to be you."
"You don't."
"Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future."
"Really?"
"Mmmm."
"You do?"
"I do."
"Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)"
"It's never gonna happen."
"(innocently) What?"
"You and Rachel."
"(acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?"
"Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the"
"No, no, no. I'm not in the zone."
"Ross, you're mayor of the zone."
"I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean,every day I get just a little bit closer to..."
"Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you'rethinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever."
"I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him)What? What, now?"
"Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight?You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into theroom behind them)"
"Shhhh!"
"What are you shushing?"
"We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.(everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?"
"Ahhhh!"
"See?"
"Huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)"
"Would you like some gum?"
"Um, is it sugarless?"
"(checks) Sorry, it's not."
"Oh, then no thanks."
"(singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. Butto me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (shewrites the lyrics down)"
"(to Joey) OK, here goes."
"Are you going to do it?"
"I'm going to do it."
"Do you want any help?"
"You come out there, you're a dead man."
"Good luck, man."
"Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK."
"OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)"
"Hey, where are you going?"
"Outside."
"You can't go out there."
"Why not?"
"Because of... the reason."
"And that would be?"
"I, um, can't tell you."
"Joey, what's going on?"
"OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I toldyou."
"About what?"
"He's planning your birthday party."
"Oh my God! I love him!"
"(as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised."
"About what?"
"My surprise party!"
"What surprise party?"
"Oh stop it. Joey already told me."
"Well, he didn't tell me."
"Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing."
"This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything."
"No, you are not. We tell you stuff."
"Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by thepeacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he wasmoving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Lookslike I was second to last."
"Hmmm... this is so nice."
"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..more of a general wondering... ment."
"OK."
"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
"Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)"
"Yes, yes, that's right..."
"Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)"
"What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!"
"(to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt."
"Sorry, that was wax."
"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner."
"Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?"
"During a blackout? He'd get trampled!"
"(nonchalantly) Yeah?"
"You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives hima stick of gum, and a strange look)"
"(stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things,right?"
"Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just foundthis cat and we're looking for the owner."
"Er, yeah, it's mine."
"(trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are yousure?"
"Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat."
"Wait a minute. What's his name?"
"Ehhhh... B-Buttons."
"Bob Buttons?"
"Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons."
"(the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!"
"(as Phoebe and Rachel leave) You owe me a cat."
"Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, littlekitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty..."
"(something Italian)"
"Wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)"
"(rolling) Lucky sixes...."
"(entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, Iwant you to meet my friends. This is Monica."
"(smitten) Hi!"
"And Joey...."
"Hi!"
"And Ross."
"Hi!"
"(something in Italian)"
"(proudly) He doesn't speak much English."
"(pointing at game)"
"Look at that!"
"(jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
"Oh... Italy, I think."
"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives."
"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!"
"That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him."
"Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kittyanywhere."
"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat."
"Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... sincenobody told me... this is Paolo."
"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe."
"(something in Italian, he is apparently attracted to Phoebe)"
"(smiling) You betcha!"
"(chewing gum)"
""
""
"Are you alright?"
"My God, you're choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gumflies from his mouth) That better?"
"(gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was...."
"Perfection?"
"(something romantic in Italian about Rachel and the stars)"
"(mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah...."
"Wha-What did he say that was so funny?"
"I have absolutely no idea."
"That's... that's classic."
"(to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am Idoing? This is so un-me!"
"If you want, I'll do it."
"I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But Iwon't."
"God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were moreexciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry."
"You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare ather)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK."
"Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothingin common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd...."
"Paolo. Hi."
"Ross!"
"Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I...we're kind of a thing."
"Thing?"
"Thing, yes. Thing."
"Ah, you... have the sex?"
"No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see,that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together.You know, and if you get in the.... um..."
"Bed?"
"No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the..."
"Oh!"
"Yeah!"
"Si."
"So you do know a little English."
"Poco... a leetle."
"Do you know the word"
"No."
"That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!"
"Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy."
"OK."
"Ready? (she swings the pen around her head in a circle)"
"No, you've got to whip it."
"Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...(time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the roomgets completely dark)"
"Thank you."
"Thanks."
"Kinda... spooky without any lights."
"(does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!"
"OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah..."
"Oh.. oh... oh."
"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you haveto throw a party for Monica."
"Well, this has been fun."
"Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving mylife."
"Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. (she kisses him on thecheek) See ya."
"Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you gotany of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape."
