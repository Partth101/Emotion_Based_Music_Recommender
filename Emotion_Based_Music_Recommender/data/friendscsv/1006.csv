"(she enters) Hey..."
"Hey!"
"Hi!"
"Pheebs, what's wrong?"
"Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...   (she shows her ring)"
"OH!"
"My God!"
"Hey!"
"So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared,   or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah, big surprise,   I like proposals!"
"Well, it was"
"Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast Phoebe)   Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and...   (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike!"
"Whoo!"
"Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh, and I have something for   you!"
"Mmh-mmh!"
"It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers   of all the guys I've dated."
"Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what,   I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?"
"I would, but you're the last one."
"(angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start   reading) Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?"
"Oh, my first love!"
"Oh!"
"What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?"
"Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh, it's OK, no,  he  was"
"Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my   black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin.   With Janice's phone number on it."
"Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?"
"(proud of herself) Oh yes, they are."
"(he enters) Hey honey!"
"(Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back.   Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) Hi sweetie!"
"Is Monica not here?"
"No."
"Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for  a big account and they"
"Cool!"
"Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas   were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there?"
"That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?"
"Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're   right for the part."
"What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon!   Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired!   (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'm cold!! Huh??   Come on! What can't I do?"
"First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think   you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor."
"I can do that! (in a deeper voice) "Hello, I'm   your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing.   I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?"
"Software that facilitates inter-business networking   e-solutions?"
"(after a long pause he starts miming again) I'm cold!"
"(to Charlie) Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Guess who's a finalist for a"
"Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand   up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!"
"Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds   of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not    that I'm keeping score or anything..."
"Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!"
"Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get   it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research!"
"Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?"
"Yeah. Why?"
"Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant."
"Your ex-boyfriend?"
"Yeah."
"So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new   boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!"
"No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything,   I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner   together, and I can introduce you."
"Well, if you think it would help."
"Yes, absolutely. I'll call him."
"Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know,   butter him up? Anything he really likes?"
"Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish."
"We'll see how dinner goes."
"(looking at Monica entering) Hey!"
"Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?"
"Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing   out stuff, so Mike could move in."
"Oh, right."
"Yeah."
"Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you   with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!"
"Oh, it's"
"Uh, Chandler did! What does he want"
"Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific painting   with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and   she gasps.) Oh! What a tragic loss!"
"Yeah. I really"
"(faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know..."
"Why, you don't like her?"
"Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll   take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too   easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!"
"Really? You think?"
"Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry   Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!""
"Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just   realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her."
"Damn it, I did"
"Hey you guys."
"Hey you guys."
"Hi!"
"Oh! Any word on casting yet?"
"Joe, I told you, you're just not right for   the part."
"What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor   you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?"
"I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna   be interested in."
"Joe..."
"Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't   pass it on to your bosses!"
"Fine!"
"Thank you. (he sits down)"
"Work, Joe!"
"Damn it! (he leaves)"
"Just pass it to your boss!"
"He's not right for the part. So if I suggest   him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should   learn on their own!"
"Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked   it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and   they're the bad guys."
"That's good! I liked it, they didn't.   (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake,   go to work! (Joey runs away)."
"I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart.   I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner   party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley   or C3PO?"
"(glances over Ross' shoulder) Sorry, looks   like it's just him."
"Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!"
"Well, I... I am having a good hair day."
"So good to see you."
"Me too. (she and Benjamin are hugging for very long   and Ross starts pretending to clear his throat, until they stop)"
"I'm ok."
"I'm sorry... (introduces them to each other) Ross   Geller... Benjamin Hobart."
"It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell   you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,   (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of   the reasons I got into the field."
"Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've   never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!"
"Shall we? (they sit down and Benjamin takes Ross'   chair)."
"(to Ross) Thank you! (to Charlie). I can't   believe that you chose"
"Oh my God, I completely forgot! (they laugh) Oh  my  God! I can't believe they let us back"
"No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image,   you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz,   mmm."
"Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal,   while I go to the ladies room?"
"So, tell me about it."
"Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert."
"M-m."
"See, there are still several areas that haven't   been fully excavated."
"Break up with Charlie!"
"What?"
"What?"
"Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?"
"Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I   didn't not say it."
"Kind of inappropriate,"
"I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so   long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much   I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her."
"Are you"
"If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then   I'm joking!"
"No!"
"Joking it is!"
"Hi! Sorry, I'm late."
"Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you   keep the painting?"
"No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me   keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news   is, Gladys is yours!"
"Wow, what's the bad news!"
"Who's Gladys?"
"Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know,   with the woman coming out of the frame."
"(sarcastic)"
"Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!"
"Huh!"
"Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already   gave that to Monica, so..."
"You know, I would give her up, for you."
"No, I couldn't let you do that."
"But I want to."
"But I don't want you to."
"But I insist!"
"But I insist"
"Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads,   she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the   coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours!"
"No, that landed in your food!"
"(sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair   and square."
"Hey Joe!"
"What's up?"
"Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along   to my bosses and they weren't interested."
"(sounds disappointed) Oh."
"(Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man."
"(looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm..."
"(sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey   continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it.   Stupid"
"(sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape."
"(looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!"
"Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?"
"I'm not lying to you, I watched it!"
"Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room   and is observing the conversation)"
"I watched it!"
"Keep going Pinocchio!"
"(now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!"
"(yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards   his room)"
"(following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape.   (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)"
"Did you watch the tape?"
"(In a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone)   No!"
"The selection committee has chosen the three of   you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers   you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you   claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you   propose to correct this problem?"
"Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological   evidence. I plan to begin there."
"(nods) Interesting."
"(Rolls his eyes) I guess!"
"Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work.   Where might that take place?"
"Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my   birthday?"
"(shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I...   (Benjamin looks at him as if to say "What's wrong? Answer the question")"
"Care to venture a guess?"
"(annoyed) May 12th?"
"(looks surprised and un-impressed) That's not even   kinda close! (Ross looks around confused) Dr. Li, how many graduate students   you'd be needing?"
"Half a dozen."
"I see, and Dr. Biely?"
"Three for excavation and two for analysis."
"Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit   was later covered by a popular British invasion band?"
"(even more shocked) Wha..? I need"
"No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's   You". Baby It's You."
"Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my   questions have anything to do with Paleontology."
"You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question.   Spell "Boscodictiasaur"."
"(annoyed) um... I've never"
"Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it."
"(stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it   correctly) B - O - S ..."
"No, it starts with a silent "M"."
"Oh come on!!"
"I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!"
"But you"
"What did I just say?"
"You still here?"
"Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am   insulted. When I tell somebody I did something..."
"Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok?   First, you lied, right?"
"Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?"
"(very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?   (goes back into his room)"
"Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)"
"(comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't   watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you"
"(Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you   didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door)."
"He really"
"(smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to   your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')"
"(faking happiness) Oh, my!"
"(surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh,   she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh   so proudly? (looks around for a spot)"
"(sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to   do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet!"
"Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to   the spot where her famous French poster is hanging)."
"(genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can   get rid of that French poster."
"(offended) I like that poster!"
"Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it.   Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?"
"(jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's   nothing above your bed!!"
"(Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here?"
"Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology   related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling)   Aunt Margaret's pants size?"
"I've come here to apologize. I think I may have   let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process."
"(Sarcastic) No! Stop!"
"Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant."
"(Skeptical) Really?"
"Well... there is just one small... stipulation..."
"I have to break up with Charlie?"
"Hey, you got one right!"
"You're crazy."
"Crazy, or... romantic?"
"Crazy!"
""
"(Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)"
"O-oh my God!"
"(enters from his bedroom) What?"
"Joey, what... is... this..."
"I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a"
"Joey, we're not keeping this!"
"But it's an original Buffay..."
"Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't   mind that she's haunted."
"Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?"
"Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive   when you're asleep."
"She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body   across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice)   And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your   doorknob."
"GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!"
"Hey! I sold that to Joey."
"Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at   this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)"
"No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes   the painting back to Rachel)"
"Yes I can! (pushes her back again)"
"No you can't. She's yours!"
"She's yours!"
"SHE'S YOURS!"
"She's yours!"
"Hey! (there's a pause)"
"She's mine!"
"She's m-i-i-ne!"
"She's mine!"
"She's mine!"
"You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her   anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous   painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress   and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls   are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are   gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)"
"I want Gladys!"
"She's mine!"
"She's mine!"
"She's mine!"
"She's mine!"
"Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And   I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part   or not."
"That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you   lied."
"I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you   to forgive me?"
"Oh my God!"
"Excellent!"
"Now, what do you say?"
"Lying is wrong!"
"And?... AND?"
"I'm a pretty little girl."
"I knew it!"
"Your ex-boyfriend is insane."
"Did you get the grant?"
"No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your   ex-boyfriend is still in love with you."
"What?"
"Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because"
"Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up   with"
"Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review,   who was the voice of "Underdog"?"
"I'm sure he was just joking, Ross."
"If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay?   I'm telling you, he didn't ask me"
"Seriously?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do   you spell Mboscodictiosaur?"
"Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then   M-B-O..."
"Damnit!"
"Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are   you doing here?"
"I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you   tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the   voice of Underdog!"
"Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross,   this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia."
"No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in   the eyes, and tell her the truth."
"Benji?"
"Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's   only because I still love you. And I would do"
"Too little, too late, Benji!"
"I can't believe this."
"I never should have broken up with you. I think   about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?"
"(indignant) No!"
"Yes!"
"What?"
"I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so....   romantic."
"or..."
"Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here,   but is there any chance you will take me back?"
"Maybe..."
"Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a   little uncomfortable."
"Oh God! I am so sorry, but... (she puts her hand   on Ross's cheek) I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know..."
"(puts his hand on Ross's other cheek) I'm sorry   too..."
"I love you!"
"I love you too! (and they start to kiss)"
"Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!"
"Gladys?"
"Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not   get old."
"You're mean!"
"Oh, don't be such a baby!"
