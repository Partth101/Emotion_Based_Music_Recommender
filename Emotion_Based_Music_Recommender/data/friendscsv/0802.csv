"Score! Where are the disposable cameras?"
"What disposable cameras?"
"The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?"
"No you didn’t."
"Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and Isaid…"
"Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, andmy Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why dothey call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you didthat."
"So you don’t have the cameras?!"
"No. Sorry man."
"So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!"
"Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel.I’ll-I’ll help you look for them."
"Great."
"In-in three minutes."
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?"
"No! (Pause) But, they’re callin’ out to me! I mean this littleguy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn’tmind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?"
"A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an oldwoman."
"A tiny salt shaker!!!"
"Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!"
"Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun."
"Oh yeah."
"Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest ofthem."
"Okay."
"Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. Imean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?"
"Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set.Y’know, it’s probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)"
"Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)"
"(entering) Hi."
"Hey, how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness?"
"Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they?"
"No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinksthat Phoebe’s pregnant."
"Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. Hehasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad forthe woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course."
"Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for afew more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today."
"Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the firstfloor?"
"Ew! No!"
"What?! I think he’s cute."
"Well then you have his baby."
"Believe me I’m trying."
"Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guytoday and he has no idea what’s gonna happen."
"Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his lifeforever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexualmagnetism."
"Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news."
"Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue!He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. Irock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different."
"Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m notgonna ask him for anything."
"Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’swalking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!"
"What was that bam?"
"I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus."
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you thatshe was pregnant?"
"(warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she havean accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into thatSunglass Hut!"
"Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybodypregnant!"

"Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebehug.)"
"Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father?"
"You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to dowith me or the baby. (She sits down like she’s pregnant.)"
"Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him downand kick his ass!"

"No. Did you?"
"Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating."
"Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager,no-one’s turned them."
"Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thingthat was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed."
"Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?"
"All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’tbelieve I screwed this up!"
"I’m sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Here’sa thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty ofdressed up people."
"Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?"
"No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) atthe gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is makesure not to get anybody else’s faces."
"Are you serious?"
"I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do youreally want to start your life together by letting her down?"
"Marriage advice? Really?!"
"I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’tthese the same flowers?"
"I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers."
"What about the chairs?"
"She picked those out too."
"How about the place settings?"
"That was her."
"What did you do?"
"I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?"

"Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I calledthe father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!"
"What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?"
"I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a prettyblond girl with an ass that won’t quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) Ibelieve this belongs to the father of your baby."
"Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now?"
"Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip theBand-Aid off. What to you want to do?"
"Uh, let’s rip!"
"Really? Are you sure?"
