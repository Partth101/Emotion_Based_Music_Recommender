"(indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them toRachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (Shestarts giving Chandler a massage.)"
"(seeing the look on Chandler's face) He-he does not like it! He hatesit! He's in pain!"

"(wincing) Yes, he is!"
"What?!"
"I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!"
"You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that."
"Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings."
"But the minute we start to lie to each other… (Pauses after sherealizes what she's saying.) And by 'we' I mean society."
"Any time you're ready, Joey."
"(reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get atable and I'll buy you a drink."
"(stopping him) I'm sorry. Could you, could you try itwithout the purse?"

"Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-Ijust wish you could tell me—just say, "I don't like your massages.""
"(falling into that trap) I don't like your massages."
"(starting to cry) See? It's no big deal."
"Okay, but now see you're crying!"
"I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened atwork."
"What?"
"(bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages."
"It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything."
"Oh my God! You don't know me at all!"
"Okay, you give the worst massages in the world."
"I'm crying here!!"
"Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the"
"Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best badmassage, well who would get that?"

"Yes, yes I was."
"Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium,or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?"
"It really says that?!"
"Yeah. See? (Quickly shows him.)"
"Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C."
"Hmm, okay,"
"Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. (Gets up toleave.) But umm… Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you giveLilly that, please? (Hands her a note.)"
"What?!"
"Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note?Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at methe way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note,would you give it to her please?"

"Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!"
"Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, (Sits down next to her and brushes against herleg.) Oops. (He backs up.) I just, I-I-I-I don’t, I don’t know what to say. Ijust can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty."
"Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there."
"So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, verysorry that I left?"
"Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make adifference anyway, so you can just go."
"All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father."
"That's a defense?"
"Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers onbackwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!"
"You make up songs?"
"Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how didit, how did it go. Umm. (Singing.)"
"I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm… (Backsaway.)"
"Well, I am. (Moves over and takes his hand.)"
"Not yet, no. (Drops his hand and moves back.)"
"(dejected) Hi."
"Hey!"
"Hey man, how did the audition go?"
"Estelle said I didn't get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.)"
"What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!"
"Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problemswith me."
"What kind of problem?"
"Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with thebag!"
"Oh my God!"
"Nooooo!"
"Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!"
"Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag."
"I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?(She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!"
"Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you arewith it… (Looks for help.)"
"Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)"
"…I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag."
"I can't believe I'm hearing this!"
"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’thave a bag, I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause)controversial."
"Yeah umm, they're called wallets."
