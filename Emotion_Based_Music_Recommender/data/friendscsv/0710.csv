"Hey!"
"Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50."
"Hey Pheebs!"
"Hey! (she sits down next to him)"
"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entirebuilding, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or avile of small pox to release in the hallway?"
"It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticksin the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is soannoying."
"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to reactto drums."
"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna livethere anymore?"
"Maybe on some level."
"Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in theair."
"What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?"
"(entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got youanother present. (She puts it on the counter)"
"Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (He plays a drum-roll) Okay, whatis it?"
"It's a…tarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stooljumping up) Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big,gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?"
"What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, Ihad a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then mycat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?"
"Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! (He storms intohis room)"
"Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula."
"(sarcastic) Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joeyis the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. (She turns around, about to leave)"
"What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?"
"Our apartment is ready."
"And that makes you angry because…"
"Because you would rather live here with Joey."
"Where did you get that?"
"Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. Andapparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that."
"Phoebe?"
"Hm?"
"Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of theapartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, youknow how fish freaked me out!"
"(nods along) Fish!"
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna livetogether, we're roommates; that's the deal."
"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you'rehaving so much fun over here…"
"Oh, it's so much more fun with you."
"We did have fun, didn't we?"
"We did!"
"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight."
"Oh, I would love to!"
"Yay, okay!"
"Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets thesticks)"
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop."
"(with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage andputs the sticks into it) Done!"
"Hey!"
"Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?"
"No, these are my pants."
"Oh. Okay! How can I help you?"
"Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?"
"Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man."
"Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and Ireally don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something."
"I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here towish you (Points to Ben) a Merry Christmas!"
"What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?"
"(to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas."
"Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the wayfrom…Texas."
"Texas?"
"That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states.And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. (He tries to benddown to pick up the bag with the presents, but can't because of the costume) Maybe theLady will help me with these presents."
"Wow! Thanks!"
"You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!"
"Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish."
"(gasps) You are? Me, too!"
"Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?"
"(to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what ifthe Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?"
"Cool!"
"Yeah!"
"Come on Ben."
"Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees..."
"(entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!"
"Santa! (Runs to Chandler and hugs him)"
"Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)"
"What are you doing here, Santa?"
"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here,weird…turtle-man?"
"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here togive Ben some presents. Remember?"
"What?"
"Did you bring me any presents, Santa?"
"You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the moneyfalls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his handsweren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!"
"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, theArmadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thoughtI'd say."
"(to Chandler) What are you doing?"
"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santacostume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
"Thank you, but, but you gotta leave."
"Why?"
"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, andyou're-you’re wrecking it."
"But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly."
"I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me."
"Fine, I'll give the suit back."
"(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has areally teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)"
"Santa? Really?"
"Yes, is that okay?"
"Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?"
"No."
"Then it's okay! (They kiss.)"
"Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!"
"No! Why does he have to go?"
"Because, if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo? (Ross nods) ...areever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!"
"No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!"
"Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay."
"Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben,will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?"
"Okay, Santa!"
"All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, therewere these people called the Maccabees."
"(entering wearing a"
"Oh wow! Look at this place!"
"Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’teven feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!"
"(yelling from another room) Oh my God!"
"What?"
"(returning) Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that yourgrandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?"
"Yeah?"
"And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would findout and then tear it down?"
"Yeah?"
"Do you really not know where I’m going with this? (Phoebe nods,"No.") It left! It’s one huge room!"
"Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!"
"See?"
"Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up."
"You can’t, because of the new skylight!"
"There’s a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.)Wow!!"
"So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?"
"(returning slowly) Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um, mygrandmother would not be comfortable with that."
"Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?"
"A little bit, yeah."
"Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?"
"You heard her too?! You have the gift!"
"Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey."
"Are you sure?"
"Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun.Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you."
"Oh me too."
"I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen,I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keepthe one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?"
"No, I do not hear that."
"…and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’vejust lasted just one day, burned for…"
"(answering him) Eight whole days."
"That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. Theend."
"Awesome!"
"Yeah?"
"My favorite part was when"
"The Armadillo was actually not so"
"(entering with Phoebe) Hey!"
"Oh."
"(seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the EasterBunny’s funeral in here."
"Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!"
"Oh."
"Oh."
"Okay, I understand why"
"I got it!"
"(yelling from the bedroom) Is it back in the cage?"
"Its back in cage!"
"Cage closed?"
"Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!"
