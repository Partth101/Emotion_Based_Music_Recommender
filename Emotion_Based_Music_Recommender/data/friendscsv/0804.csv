"You’re welcome buddy."
"(glaring at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)"
"And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offeredto help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing youknow out of nowhere Ross comes on to me."
"(laughs) Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading."
"What is?"
"The lie you just told."
"That-that you came on to me?"
"There’s the one!"
"But you did! I mean, let’s be honest."
"Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh, it’s-it’s not important.What is important is that, is that we’re having a baby. And it’snot—Doesn’t matter who came on to who."
"Whom. (Everyone looks at him shocked.) That’s right."
"You know you kissed me first."
"What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending mesignals all over the place!"
""
"Yeah!"
"Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Rossbegging symbols, please show of hands. (Ross raises his hand and no one else.)"
"Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what youbelieve! What matters is what happened!"
"Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe Ineed to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?"
"Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it."
"No please, show me how I begged you!"
"I can show you, I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) It’s anexpression."
"I can’t"

"Y’know who has a great video camera?"
"(nasally) Greg and Jenny?"
"Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em."
"Let’s call ‘em."
"Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!"

"You got fake numbered."

"Oh I think we do."
"They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?"
"I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all thoseinsightful, great questions."
"And you’ve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!"
"Y’know what? Don’t worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe."
"Excuse me, I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects."
"(entering) Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open thedoor!"
"Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!"
"Okay, listen I am not a pervert!"
"That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise yourright hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!"
"Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here’s whathappened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and ahalf ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing."
"Personal thing? What personal thing? I don’t know."
"About…about sex? (Joey looks at him confused) That I hadn’t hadsex in months?"
"(laughs) Yeah I knew what you were talkin’ about."
"Hey!"
"Hey."
"Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about somethingI’m, I’m really uncomfortable talking about."

"Whoa, for like months?"
"Five to be lying, six."
"Six months? Whoa that’s rough."

"(stopping him) Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please, please, you werein Western Europe and?"
"I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. Iwas at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded.And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly)And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she wascrying…"
"(intently listening) Why?"
"Umm, this is great wine."
"It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm,a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe."
"Really?"
"Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona."

"I think its Tibidabo."
"Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!"
"Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?"
"Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Yourstory sucks!"
"Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tellit right! Show me how you did it."
"No! No, I don’t…don’t want to."
"How long since you’ve seen a girl naked?"
"I was backpacking across Western Europe."
"I’m not feeling it."
"I was just outside Barcelona, hiking…"
"No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot?"
"It’s been six months! I’m always hot!"
"Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like youdon’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do whenI’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera andyou can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong."
"I’ll try that."
"All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good togo. Just hit record. All right?"
"Thanks."
"Good luck."
"Thanks. And-and hey Joe?"
"Yeah?"
"Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’llhelp you out."
"(trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me man. (Exits.)"
"Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?(Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!"
"Oh Ross!"
"Hi!"
"Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talkingto yourself?"
"That’s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was."
"(voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot aboutthe camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything."
"Yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of themagree.)"
"Yeah, definitely."
"What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!"
"Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget thetape!"
"Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, "You’ll show me right?")No!"
"You’re right. (Mouths, "I know you’ll show me, right?)"
"Joey! No!"
"Loud and clear! (Mouths, "You’ll show me," and nods.)"
"I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number."
"Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’tgive you real names either."
"Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give outfake names."
"Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you."
"Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)"
"I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong."
"I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes."
"I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!"
"(rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey andPhoebe laugh.)"
"Well maybe it was all of your questions."
"What about my questions?"
"The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!"
"Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?"
"(angrily) Was that another question?"
"(entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?"
"Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and itdoes, it sounds like an honest mistake."
"Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I tapedit? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father ofmy child, the porn king of the west village."
"Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, Ididn’t even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) Ithought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)"
"Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it withher shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They allyell again.) You don’t want to see this do you?"
"Hell yeah!!!"
"I am"
"No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it."
"Forget it, she’s destroying it."
"Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to putthe whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!!"
"Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can dowhatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story."
"I wanna see it."
"What?!"
"Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’twant people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes mewant to see it. You see?"
"(confused) Are we watchin’ the tape or not?!"
"I don’t want people to see it for your sake."
"Ahh, I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to seeyou begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)"
"Rachel, please…"
"Ah, a little preview!"
