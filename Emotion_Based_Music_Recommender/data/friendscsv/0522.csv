"Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I wantyou to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new."
"Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye."

"Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a bighotel suite?"
"Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have areal big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room."
"I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a bighotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?"
"Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes rightin Joey's pocket."
"So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?"
"Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for tenyears." I'm gonna be a millionaire!"

"Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon."
"We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the roadonce."
"Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quicklylooks at the road.) I think I just need lunch."

"Too dry."
"Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?"
"No!"
"Is this movie gonna be my big break?"
"No!"
"(shocked) What?!"
"Yes."
"Dude you said, "No!""
"I also said, "Yes!""
"You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?"
"No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!"
"I don't believe this!"
"Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high."
"What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!"
"They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!"
"Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping allover my big break."
"Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break."
"Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause ifit is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone."

"Get out!!"
"All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's nosidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here."
"Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?"

"Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?"
"No that made me feel precious."
"Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar?Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!"
"Yeah? Sometimes it's… (Does the fist thing.)"
"Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when hestarts to lose."
"Okay,"
"Eh! Stop it!"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Chandler! What are you doing here?"
"Hey!"
"Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!"
"Why?!"
"I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game whereyou-you ask a question and you answer it really fast."
"That game should not be played without my supervision."
"Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was thatuh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to doanything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, heshould've pushed me off of the bridge."
"What's in the bag?"
"Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some giftsthat I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear withone leg?"

"Okay!"
"No drops!"
"Great!"
"Okay."
"Okay."
"On three, 1…2…3! (Rachel turns her head on three to avoid thedrops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed theeyedropper.)"
"Well, well, you said it was practice!"
"Then why did you move?!"
"Because I knew you were lying!"
"All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch byher legs.)"
"(as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God!Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)"

"Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!"
"Monica! Stop it!"
"(spitting out the eyedropper) Damn! It's empty!"
"Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make afortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqué pose,at least for primetime TV.)"

"Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to himif he won't even talk to me?"
"Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to LasVegas he'll know that you're sorry."
"That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket ofporn…"
"No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!"
"Really?"
