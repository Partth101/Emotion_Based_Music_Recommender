"Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell upto twice their size and never go back."
"(looking at her fingers) Oh my…God! Let me see that! (Grabs thebook from him.)"
"(laughing) You fall for it every time!"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hi!"
"I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)"

"No."
"He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight?Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend."
"Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey, are you sure you’re nottalking about your imaginary boyfriend."
"No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven’t thought about him in a longtime… (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, ummWill’s, Will’s here on business and he didn’t have a place to go so Iinvited him here."
"Oh that’s nice."
"Oh, and by the way, he’s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looksgoo-ood! Okay, I mean"
"I just want you to say it once in a while."
"All right okay, just so you know, I’m not gonna make a turkey thisyear."
"What?!"
"Well Phoebe doesn’t eat turkey…"
"Phoebe!"
"Turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!"
"No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!"
"All right! Okay, it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet,Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel’s having her aversion topoultry."
"She is?"
"Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roastchicken?"
"Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand andmade it walk across the table."
"Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey forjust three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work."
"But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with noturkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!"
"All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’sgonna be a ton left over."
"No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!"
"All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in justone sitting?"
"That’s right! ‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And thisis what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don’t read alot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!"
"Hey, isn’t weird to think about how next year at this timethey’ll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeinghim) Rachel’s! But good to know where you’re at!"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Happy Thanksgiving!"
"You too!"
"Anything I can do to help?"
"Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he’sreally into the game so I don’t want to bother him. Could you help me fold thesenapkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)"
"Sure!"
"I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams."

"Well normally I don’t, but y’know…(looks at theTV)…Green Bay is playing."
"You like Green Bay?"
"Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it’s not bad.It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August toJune."

"(to Will) Wanna give me a hand?"
"Sure! Monica, I can’t get over how great you look! You look stunning!"

"Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!"
"Good. And Rachel Green too. (Will stops suddenly.)"
"Oh."
"Is there a problem?"
"Nope. Uh, it’s okay. It’s just uh, God I hated her."

"Oh okay."
"Oh come on!"
"Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!"
"Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you’ve got almost anentire turkey to eat."
"Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomachfirst. Eatin’ chips is like stretching."
"All right."
"Don’t worry, Tribbianis never get full."
"I actually know what you’re talking about. I’m here to tell yousomething my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void."

"(To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?"
"Umm, I’m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?"
"I don’t know? Do I? Do I?"

"I’m-I’m—I had no idea. I’m sorry. I…"
"Well you should be. Screw it! Bring on the yams!"
"Oh Will. But you-you’ve worked so hard…"
""
"Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will whostarts dishing out a large helping.)"
"Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whateverI-I did to you in high school…"
"Oh, it wasn’t just me. We had a club!"
"You had a club?!"
"That’s right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!"
"Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Whoelse was in this club?"
"Me and Ross. (Points at Ross.)"
"No need to point, she knows who Ross is."
"(To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?"
"Yes he was. (Holds up his hand for a high-five.)"
"No. No."
"So who else was in this club?"
"Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand butI-I don’t think he-he knew what it was."
"So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in anI Hate Rachel club."
"You went out with her?! We had a pact!"
"That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever."
"Then why did it have the word eternity in it?"
"Okay Monica, did you know about this?!"
"I swear I didn’t. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys usedto go up to your bedroom and lock the door?"
"Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say."
"Look Rach I-I’m sorry, okay? I…I was a stupid kid, okay? Theonly reason I joined…"
"Co-founded!"
"…co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in lovewith you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the IHate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club."
"Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club."
"Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just saymean things about me?"
"Well, we did a little more than that."
"No-no! No-no. No-no."
"What?! What else did you do?"
"We started a rumor."
"What rumor?"
"Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!"
"Ross!"
"It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…thatumm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts."
"What?!"
"That’s right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raiseyou as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis."
"(shocked) Oh my God!"
""
"What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)"
"Everyone at our school heard it!"
"Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphroditecheerleader from Long Island?!"
"Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! Thisis why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stayin this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)"
"Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really ourfault."
"Monica, how come you never told me this?!"
"I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry andthen show it to me."
"Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!"
"I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof."
"Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)"
"You are my Everest."
"Joey, you don’t have to finish that."
"Oh yes I do. Otherwise what’s next? Today I’m just a guy whocan’t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I’m the guy who eats half a"
"(entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrotein my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, you’re such a good person." Notgirl! Person!"
"Rach, I think you’re reading a little too much into it."
"(reading what he wrote again) "Dear Rach, you’re a greatperson. Sorry about your tiney-wienie." (Will laughs.)"
"Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in theentire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!"
"Yes!"
"Could you also tell them I’m skinny now?"
"Oh! Me too!"
"Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a millionyears ago!"
"I don’t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was halfand half! Y’know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you inhigh school."
"That’s not totally true."
"What?"
"What?"
"Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs.Altman, our 50-year-old librarian."
"(shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!"
"It’s true?!!"
"No."
"Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!"
"Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he wentback to Thailand."
"I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a50-year-old woman?"
"Hey! She didn’t look 50!"
"Did she look 16?"
"Ohh, there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually."
"Oh! (They all look.) Wow!"
"She didn’t photograph well!"
"Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spentmost of her life sitting for oil paintings!"
"So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early birddinner?"
"I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two ofus. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you mustknow, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…"
"Didn’t she walk with a cane?"
"Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can’t believe you-you toldpeople about this?! Everybody knew?! Y’know what? (To Will) I’m back in theclub!"
"Yeah! (They high-five.)"
"I wanna join!"
"Wh—Phoebe!!"
"I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-Ididn’t go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learnFrench. Bonjour."
"All right, y’know—Fine! You guys have your stupid little club,but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you!You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)"
"All right, listen you’re just being silly. Rachel, even with thatrumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you.One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a"
"Wow…"
"And Ross, if it weren’t for Rachel’s rumor I mean no one inhigh school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!"
"As a romancer of the elderly."
"Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to bepretty."
"The eyes…did still sparkle."
"Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you’ve beenthrough so much since then. And right now you’ve got so much more important stuffgoing on in your life. Can’t you just let this go?"
"She’s right."
"Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together."
"Hold on! You got her pregnant?"
"Yeah."
"Are ya getting married?"
"Nope."
"So you knocked her up but you’re not gonna marry her. Dude! (Wantsanother high-five and Ross ignores him.) Anybody?"
"Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It’s exactly how I’d imaginedit would be."
"(entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All rightwhere’s that turkey!"
"Joey! Those are my maternity pants!"
"Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!"
"Well that’s it. I’m done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There comethe meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)"
"Well Joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you."
"Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now."
"Is there anything we can do for you?"
"No just, nobody press on my stomach."
"You can keep those pants by the way."
"Whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?"
"Yeah, you want some?"
"Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.)A little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves theknife again.) What?! Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!"
