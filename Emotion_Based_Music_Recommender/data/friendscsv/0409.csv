"Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if youbelieve any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y’know what?"
"Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back init’s drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn’t want to lose a perfectly goodassistant."
"What?"
"That’s why I said all those things about your flirting and yourdrinking…"

"Yeah! What are you saying?"
"I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro’s."
"What?"
"It’s okay, ‘cause y'know what? You don’t really need mefor the business."
"You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up topeople’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!"
"All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money youinvested,"
"For what? I can’t believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves)"
"Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)"
"I’m an assistant buyer!!"
"All right, so we’ll get a little coffee, and get energized, andwe’ll head back out."
"Yeah, all right."
"Okay."
"So, we’re having fun, right?"
"Yeah."

"I’m kinda beat."
"Actually, me too."
"Are you serious?!"
"Yeah."
"Thank God! I’m exhausted!"
"So you guys want coffees?"
"Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have adecaf."
"Yeah, me too."
"Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think Istrained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?"

"I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I usedthem as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a"
"How sad are we?"
"Yeah, I know."
"Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’rejust not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in acomfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!"
"Yeah!"
"Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to myfriends."
"Yeah!"

"We’re 29, we’re not women."
"(entering) Ohh, here you are. Y’know, I’m-I’m glad youdecided to hear me out."
"Okay, I’m hearing."
"I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came upwith a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flowerdelivery person."

"Or! A bakery delivery person."
"I wa-I wa-I wa…"
"Pizza?!"
"Monica!"
"All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, butumm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver."
"No."

"No."
"Y’know what, let’s do the catering business."

"Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!"
"I know!"
"Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God."
"I didn’t realize that she was so close."
"Yes,"
"No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a fewseconds later."
"Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothingabout an assistant buyer?"
"(starting to cry) No, I’m sorry. I have to go. (She leaves asSophie arrives.)"
"(happily) Good morning!"
"Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…"
"I sure did! (smiles)"
"I’m so excited about having Monica come on board with us.Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it’s like losing a member ofthe family. Of course, that"
"Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with apinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have therecipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?"
