"Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent itin to"
"I didn’t know"
"Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s notjust about the pictures."
"That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us."
"(showing them the page) Here, check it out. It’s the firstone, too."
"That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up."
"What?"
"I made that joke up."
"Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did."
"Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniestjoke he’d ever heard."
"Hey, tell Dan, ‘Thanks.’"
"What?"
"I’m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one isfunny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)"
"Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?"
"No."
"Seriously?"
"Well, you tell a lot of jokes!"
"Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel anybetter they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit,right?"
"Yeah, I guess."
"(entering) Hey guys."
"(jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey,"
"No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’lltell you."
"It’s my joke."
"It’s my joke."
"Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there,right?"
"Dude, you have got to turn on"
"Let’s go watch it at your place."
"Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’twant to miss when they were skinny."
"Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go outand get some new sunglasses."
"What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and thescreen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?"
"No, that’s"
"Joey, why is your cable out?"
"I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill"
"If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you somemoney?"
"No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been alittle tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot."
"Whoa ho."
"I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen tothe radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the"
"(picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealerwill let us watch the show at his place?"
"Sure."
"(with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phonebill?"
"Not so much."
"(entering) Hey."
"(relieved) It’s only you."
"Wh-wh-what are you doing?"
"We are looking at a"
"Oh, I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out apicture). Yikes!"
"So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell astory?"
"Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she haslost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where arethey, where are they?’"
"Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that."
"Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn,lift up your shirt, and bend over?"
""
"You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’soutdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come inhandy"
"Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date,who would it be?"
"(thinks) I don’t know."
"Me neither."
"Rachel."
"What?!"
"I don’t know. (Pause) Me neither."
"You forget how many great songs Heart had."
"Yeah."
"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard."
"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it."
"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, butI’m not even sure I got it."
"What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey."
"And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions."
"(stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke."
"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is whyhe sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars."
"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money."
"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll showthe sexy teller that I am a published writer."
"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke."
"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?"
"Yeah!"
"Well, I’m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down)."
"Okay (he goes to sit down)."
"(handing Joey the bill) Here you go."
"Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m notworking, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff."
"Well, if you want, you can work here."
"Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on asoap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have towait on all my friends."
"Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel asmuch as you want."
"What?!"
"Flexible hours."
"Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?"
"(visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it,but it was obvious. She picked Rachel."
"(visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it."
"It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel."
"You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Rossdid? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know?And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes."
"That’s a good idea."
"Yeah!"
"Do you know what’s a bad idea?"
"Picking Rachel."
"That’s right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hearsomething?"
"Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealingmy thoughts."
"It’s coming from the living room."
"(sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat backto bed.)"
"(entering) Hey, you guys."
""
"(laughing) Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys makesuch a cute couple."
"Monica, what are you doing?"
"(laughing harder) Nothing, I’m just trying to recreatesome of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when youpicked Rachel over me? That was funny."
"I guess it was kinda funny."
"(angrily) It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that?Why didn’t you pick me?"
"Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel thanyou is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okaylet’s go to lunch!"
"That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay,prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!"
"No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re justnot as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’sall."
"(To Monica) Well, people are different."
"Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want.Y’know, you can just walk all over her."
"What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover?I’m not a pushover."
"Oh, okay, (laughing) you’re not a pushover."
"Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, youknow what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I thinkthat’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go tolunch. (She leaves)"
"(to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs hercoat and leaves, too.)"
"I cannot believe her."
"I know. Where do you wanna go eat?"
"Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place."
"I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there."
"All right, wherever you wanna go is cool."
"All right."
"(showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check thisout."
"Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up."
"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m headingup there."
"Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man."
"Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there."
"No."
"No, thank you."
"(to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, ‘cause I’mheading up there."
"I’d love an ice water."
"You got it."
"Joey, what are you doing?"
"Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a ‘what’s wrong withyou?’ look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)"
"Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there."
"Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they’re inon a secret together.)"
"Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron."
"Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put onaprons."
"Joey, do you work here?"
"No."
"Hey, waiter."
"Yeah?"
"Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?"
"It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor andnow I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction."
"So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape."
"I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guessI’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? Ijust feel kind of weird serving you guys."
"Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine."
"Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?"
"Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird."
"Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it."
"See, now it’s weird again."
"I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to makea lot of money, and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. (He laughs,then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15,coffeehouse."
"Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can passon my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at thecoffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a longway. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin."
"Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, howabout clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover."
"Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?"
"Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since Imade you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin."
"Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second."
"Okay."
"So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a littlebit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?"
"Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky."
"Hah!"
"That true, I am flaky."
"So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?"
"Yeah, totally."
"Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance."
"Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover."
"That’s great. Good for you guys."
"I am not high maintenance!"
"I am not a pushover!"
"Who said you were?"
""
"Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything."
"Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition."
"No, I’m leaving to get my hair dyed."
"Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part.Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in thisbar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’"
"That’s the whole part?"
"Okay, I’ll see you in an hour."
"Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat istaken.’"
"Oh, excuse me."
"No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?"
"I believed you were saving this seat for someone."
"So, you’d hire me, right?"
"For what?"
"Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to beclosed for about an hour."
"Huh? What?"
"Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a veryimportant issue in this month’s"
"It’s my joke."
"It’s my joke."
""
"Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this."
"Let’s have Monica decide."
"Yeah!"
"Yeah!"
"Hey Mon."
"Mon, get out here!"
"Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)"
"Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is."
"Why do I have to decide?"
"Because you’re the only one that can be fair."
"Yeah."
"I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend."
"Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the mostimportant thing in the world."
"(to Ross) Don’t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I’myour only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go."
"We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decidewhich one of us is telling the truth—me."
"Okay, Chandler, you go first."
"Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve."
"Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?"
"Can I finish my story?!"
"Do you want me to pick you?!"
"See, I would never snap at you like that."
"Continue."
"So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’sdoctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is howthe whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize hispoint.)"
"Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution?Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!"
"I’m not arguing with that."
"All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision."
"You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive towomen, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, youshould be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!Now let it go! The joke sucks!"
"It’s your joke."
"Is not."
"Hi, Chandler. There you are."
"Hi, oh hi."
"Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them whatyou were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?"
"(starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient,together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may beperceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(He falters andMonica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit."
"Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve everheard."
"Really? I’ve heard better."
"Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler."
"(To Chandler) I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thingagain?"
"Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!"
"(pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You’re a littlehigh maintenance."
"Ahhh!"
"I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’repassionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I thinkthat I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s goodtoo. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because Ilike … maintaining you."
"(embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn’t even tell him to saythat. (They hug). All right you’re off my list."
"(happily) I’m off the list. (Sits on the couch.)"
"(sits next to him) Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me tobe your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend."
"(to Monica) Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive."
"Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?"
"Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so…"
"Wow! That is a bad audition."
"How-how did you lose your job here?"
"Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be incharge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me."
"He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and leftyou in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’snot right."
"Yeah, what are ya gonna do?"
"Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’mnot going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, Ireally shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him. (Goes to thecounter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that youhave to fire him…"
"Okay."
"What?"
"He can have his job back."
"That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got thatall straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back."
"That’s great. Thanks Rach."
"Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?"
"(returning from the bathroom) Rach, you’re in my seat."
"Oh, I’m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)"
"Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend."
"I pick you, Phoebe."
"Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs."
"Yeah, well, I kinda thought."
"Hey."
"Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of theother two guys to go out with, who would you pick?"
"No way."
"I’m not answering that."
"Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I’m not answeringthat."
