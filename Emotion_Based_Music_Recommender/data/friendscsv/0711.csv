"Ohh. Mmm."
"(Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi."
"Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake."
"Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I—(Chandlerputs a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)—Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God,this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over tolook at the label on the box.)"
"(nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sentit to us."
"Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs.Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief."
"I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can'treturn a box after you've opened the box."
"Why, why not?"
"Because it's too delicious."
"Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong."
"No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna sendaway for a free one and that way we"
"(taking a bite) Oh, I’m sorry what?"
"All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y’know I’m in acoma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead."
"So…"
"Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just not my character that’snot brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?"
"Absolutely!"
"I’ll see you at 8:00."
"Okay. (Joey exits.)"
"Oh, what’s at 8:00?"
"Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month todiscuss the rest of you guys."
"Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?"
"Duly noted."
"Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow,do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?"
"What are you talking about?"
"Cousin Frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night."
""
"No."
"My God, I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad wereinvited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I wereinseparable!"
"Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends."
"Well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call AuntSheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail."
"Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kidsher precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn’thave stopped her, there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go too."
"Y’know, she tried to undress me too."
"I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then susheshim.)"
"Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!"
"Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?"
"Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joeytonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)"
"(reading the note) "Pheebs, can’t make it, got a date. Talk toyou later. Big Daddy." (Laughs) Big Daddy?"
"Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out."
"Hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monicashakes her head in disgust.)"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!"
"Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!"
"So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!"
"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility forsex!"
"Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule."
"I don’t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to showup. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better!Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (Motions that theirfriendship) is for life!"
"Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much."
"Well, it does."
"Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry. (They hug.) Howabout uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!"
"Okay, you wore me down."
"Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for theRoss-A-Tron?"
"The Ross—Is that back?!! (Chandler motions no.)"
"Hi!"
"Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!"
"So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?"
"I can’t seem to say goodbye."
"Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago andyou want more?"
"Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!"
"It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, grahamcracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling… (Pause) Wow! Mywhole mouth just filled with saliva!"
"(closing the box) Y’know what? Forget it!"
"Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re nottempted."
"Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?"
"Momma’s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with thecheesecake.)"
"Awww! Mel Torme died."
"Joey, that paper’s like a year old!"
"Aw! Does that mean the"
"(entering) Hey."
"Hey."
"Hey."
"So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it"
"Limited seating?! (Screechingly)"
"Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she sawyou-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling."
"(disgusted) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That’snot the reason she’s not inviting me!"
"Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony,just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and Iwill just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as asign of protest."
"Joan?"
"Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in theLinguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say,"
"Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited andyou got "and guest?!""
"Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I thinkthe rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…"
"(interrupting)"
"Wait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!"
"What? I can’t cancel on Joan!"
"Why not?!"
"Bec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in theLinguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?"
"Because! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’refamily y’know? Well that’s important to me."
"Okay, all right, I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan. (Does so.)"
"Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding,happiest day of her life."
"(laughs) We’ll see."
"Well, thank you for lunch."
"What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!"
"So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughsthen Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?"
"(gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Bravermanis still lying in front of her door.)"
"Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)"
"She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months."
"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her tocome back to bad cheesecake."
"No that could kill her."
"Well, we don’t want that."
"No so we’re protecting her."
"But we should take it."
"But we should move quick."
"Why?"
"Because I think I just heard her moving around in there."
"Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecakeand they take off upstairs.)"
"(gasps) (whispering) Oh my God! That’s David!"
"David who?"
"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who wentto Russia and broke my heart David!"
"(noticing Phoebe) Oh my God!"
"Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around."
"Phoebe?"
"David! (He kisses her cheek) What-what are you doing here? Aren’tyou supposed to be in Russia?"
"Yeah, I’m just, I’m just in town for a conference. Umm,"
"Well… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?"
"Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them."
"Yeah."
"Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make…"
"Uh-huh."
"Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn’t know whether Ishould call or not, y’know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y’know, Ididn’t want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wantedto see you and—but I didn’t know if you wanted to see me."
"Well, of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you allthe time."
"Really? Because"
"Really?"
"I mean, there’s a statue in Minsk…"
"Uh-huh."
"That reminds me of you"
"Yeah."
"Umm, anyway…Do you want to have dinner tonight?"
"(excited) Yes! Oh no!"
"(disappointed) Oh. Uh, what?"
"I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can youdo it tomorrow night though?"
"Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Welllisten, y’know, next time you’re in Minsk umm…"

"Uh-huh. (They go over and talk.)"
"What are you doing?"
"Well, I have plans with Joey tonight."
"So! He’ll understand!"
"No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made awhole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Justbecause, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-Ishould change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No!

"What?! Tonight?!"
"That’s what Monica said."
