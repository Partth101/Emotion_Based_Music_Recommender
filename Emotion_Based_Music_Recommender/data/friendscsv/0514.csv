"Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!"
"Noooo."
"Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!"
"Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?"
"Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and noneof them even compares to that one!"
"Y'know what you should do?"
"Huh?"
"You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond withhim. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, ormy underwear."
"I'm listening."
"(To Ross) See?"
"That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've beenwatching him for like five years so"
"He broke that."
"Well, he had gravity boots."
"Yeah, he broke those too."
"So he likes to break stuff."
"Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. (Heopens the door and stops.) Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?"
"I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out."
"Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming."
"Right. (Exits.)"
"Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (ToPhoebe) It's Chandler."
"(in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you."
"Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding thephone so that Monica can hear it as well.)"
"Eh?"
"Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said Iwasn't intrigued."
"Really?"
"Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you comeover and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more."
"I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!"
"Are you kidding?!"
"No!"
"I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenlyand slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that weknow?"

"Ooh!"
"Okay!"
"I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)"
