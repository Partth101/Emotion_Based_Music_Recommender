"Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh."

"No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole."
"Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?"
"No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just gosee a…"
"(entering, interrupting them) Hey guys! What's... (sees what they'redoing and stops, the guys are stunned)"
"Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter."
"Ahhh."
"Yeah, right."
"(to her date) Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where Iplay my music. (points to the stage)"
"Good deal."
"Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people."

"(dead serious) Fire safety is not a joke, son."
"You're right, I know."
"(to Phoebe) Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. (kisses her) See youSaturday. (leaves)"
"Okay. (watches him leave)"
"Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating thatKindergarten teacher."
"Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight."
"What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you."
"I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling twoguys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin',field-playin' juggler."
"So Pheebs, do they know about each other?"
"Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know'face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't."
"(entering) Hey guys!"
"Hey."
"Hi!"
"(going over to him) Well?!"
"(joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?"
"Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totallybenign."
"Well what is it?!"
"He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin...abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identifyit, he was reluctant to remove it."
"Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in therewith my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I meannot as lucky as people who were born with two nipples."
"At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name."
"Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross.And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross.""
"(sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!"
"Pete's breaking up with me."
"What?!"
"I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back fromAtlanta,"
"And?"
"Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's somethingbad."
"Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you."
"Really?!"
"Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you."
"...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's prettycool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life."
"That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caughton fire) Oh my God!"
"Whoa!"
"(the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!"
"Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!"
"(stopping him) No! No!"
"No, no?"
"Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic.(hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get outof here!"
"W-w-w-wait! Why?!"
"Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (shedrags him away)"
"Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-millthird nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!"
"Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.(Ross starts to take off his pants) What are you doing?"
"Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple."
"Well that's not a third nipple."
"No?"
"First of all, it's on your ass."
"Well then, what is it?!"
"Wait a minute, hold it. (He goes to the door and opens it.) Johnson!Will you come in here a moment?"
"I'm with Hamilton!"
"He's good with rear things, bring him in too."
"(starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'knowwhat, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I"
"Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should waterhis plants. If y'know what I mean."
"Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them."
"(entering with Rachel) …and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just,always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy."
"Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?"
"(disgusted) Uh."
"Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?"
"Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work.It's like I'm working in the field."
"So Pheebs, pick one of them."
"Yeah. Which one do you like more?"
"Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He'sso burly, he's sooo"
"Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince."
"Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive."
"Well sensitive is important, pick him."
"Yeah."
"Oh sure, go with the sissy."
"Jason is not a sissy!"
"Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler."
"Y'know I have dinner plans!!"
"Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies andgentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'mstumped."
"Whoa. (they all lean in to get a closer look, Ross isn't pleased)"
"Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lightsturn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights!Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command."

"Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it’s just Jason’s sosensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it’s just better thanhaving just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinkingabout the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!"
"Good luck!"
"OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look ather.) Sorry, I was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet."

"It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying inbed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazineshut in amazement.)

"Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?"
"You didn’t break up with that fireman?"
"No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’sincredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoaldrawings that he drew of me."
"Wow!"
"Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy accessto a lot of charcoal."
"So then, are you going to dump Jason?"
"Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay soJason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so’s Vince (holds up one finger onher other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vinceside) So… It’s really just about the math."

"Oh sure, we should see results—Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!(quickly wipes it off)"
"What?! What?!"
"We appear to have angered it."
"We?! We angered it?!"
"Oh, I think I see the problem. And I’m afraid we’re gonnahave to use a much stronger tool. (Ross gives him a ‘What?’ look) Love."
