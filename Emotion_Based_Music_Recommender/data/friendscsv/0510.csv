"Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are thechances I could get those guys to star in it?"
"Wait a second, I could star in it!"
"Or that."

"Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!"
"Yeah!"
"Thanks!"

"Done!"
"And it can't be Joey."
"It's not."
"Or Joseph."
"(disappointed) Oh."
"Hey, what's up?"
"I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his armaround her."
"Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
"Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in ourrelationship!!"
"You had no relationship!!"
"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to theplan!"
"Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl?Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date withDanny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subwaygirl."
"She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on thedate. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan."
"Come on, hurry!"
"Hey, how do you spell suspicious?"
"Why?"
"Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff."
"Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler"
"You're driving me crazy with that!"
"Okay, I'll stop."
"Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!"
"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now."
"You wanna play?"
"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I haveto write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule."
"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he getshome."
"(jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up anotch?"
"I'm intrigued."
"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid."
"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security depositback."
"Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts."
"Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?"
"Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to thedoor.)"
"Thank you, Happy Holidays."
"Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't… (The lady ignores her andwalks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!"
"Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yetanother guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that.(She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What isthat?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!"
"All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stopsreading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey,you're supposed to have"
"Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing."
"(entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing ovenmitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighterfluid—Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)"
"This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor notthe creator of crazy lawsuit game!"
"You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work."
"(To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs towork. (To Joey) Now come on!"
"Hey!"
"No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!(After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him theburn spots on his oven mitts.)"
"I had a really nice time tonight."
"So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out."
"I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she'sasleep on the couch."
"You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods,"Yes.") Ohhh! I saw"
"Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, thisis Rachel."
"Hi!"
"Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fixmyself up!"

"You are so dead! I'm gonna get you."
"(not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continueto ignore her.)"
"Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people putin here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?"
"No."
"Does it look like an ashtray?"
"No."
"Does it look like a urinal?"
"Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)"
"So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?"
"Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. NiceBucket!"
"Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets."
"Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'knowwhat? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with youguys. Sorry. (Leaves.)"
"(entering from her room) Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?"
"Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guyswrestle?"
"Oh-oh, yeah."
"All the time. In fact, I was undefeated."
"Uh, you weighted 200 pounds."
"Still, I was quick as a cat."
"Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girlon the subway."
"Oh, you're kidding."
"Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?"
"(laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now."
"Yeah, not since I got too strong for you."
"Too strong for me?"
"Yeah."
"You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wannago?"
"Oh fine."
"Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They startwrestling.)"
"Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.(She leaves them to wrestle.)"
"(entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in20 minutes! Come on, Joe!"
"Joey's not going."
"(To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages."
"Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?"
"Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages."
"Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work."
"(To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if herelaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done."
"I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball."
"Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have neverplayed."
"The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed."
"I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!"
"Come on look guys, don't fight."
"And the reason I'm doing this is because"
"Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?"
"If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine."
"Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game ofFireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!"
"How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now,no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!"
"I paid for those tickets!"
"No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!"
"Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)"
"…so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here (Hissister) forgets the camera!"
"Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time."
"When did that happen to you?!"
"Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that reallypretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!"
"Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging."
"Oh, this is so good (A piece of cake.) you have got to try it. (Shetakes some on her finger and feeds it to Danny. Then takes a little more and does itagain. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang stares on in shock. Then they pick up a part of itand some filling falls into his lap.)"
"Oh, damn! I got it on my pants."
"Here, I'll get it. (She grabs a napkin and tries to wipe it up. Thething that gets the rest of the gang going is that she's whipping awfully close to hiscrotch. In fact, she is whipping his crotch. Chandler's about to come out of his chair.)"
"We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set."
"Yep. (To Rachel) I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight."
"Oh, great!"
"Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!"
"That was unbelievable!"
"Okay, see? I told you!"
"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach."

"They're brother and sister!!!"
"Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look.(The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws thelint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)"
"Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there andthen you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on hisface.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-workerwalk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thoughtI told you to get outta here!"
"Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to aless high-profile spot."
"What?!"
"Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner."
"That chick can't handle my corner."
"Look, either you leave, or we remove you."
"Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.)(The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out forthat bitch. (The old lady.)"
"Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?"
