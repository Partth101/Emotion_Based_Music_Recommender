"Oh Monica that was the"
"I couldn't possibly eat another bite."
"I need something sweet."
"Does anyone wanna watch TV?"
"Yeah, sure."
"Monica your remote doesn't work."
"Phoebe, you have to lift it and point."
"Oh. Aw, forget it."
"Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game whereeveryone says one thing that they're thankful for."
"Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having."
"That's very nice."
"That's sweet, Joey."
"Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze camein out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm alsothankful for thongs. (Note: Actually, I think"
"I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. Imean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they playwith your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?"
"Are you aware that you're still talking?"
"Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?"
"Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or myeviction? Hmm."
"Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything."
"I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever."
"No-no-no!"
"Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents gotdivorced again are you?"
"Oh God, no."
"Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandlerbumming us out!"
"It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay,moved out, and abandoned its entire family."
"Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting adivorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with thehouse-boy than me."
"More turkey Mr. Chandler? (And he makes eyes at him.)"
"You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings."
"I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse."
"Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?""
"Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine'sworse!"
"In"
"Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse."
"Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any pastlife memories."
"Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new."
"I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving."
"Oh, let's not tell this story."
"Oh, come on!"
"Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuckon his head!"
"What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!"
"Hey, it's not like it sounds."
"It's"
"(muffled) Hello?"
"(surprised) Hello?"
"Phoebe?"
"Joey? What's going on?"
"Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)"
"Oh my God!"
"I know! It's stuck!!!"
"(walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?"
"I put it on to scare Chandler!"
"Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!"
"Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells"
"Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a deadanimal."
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hey, did you get the turkey basted—Oh my God! Oh my God! (She seessomeone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?"
"It's Joey."
"What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?"
"No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary."
"Well, get it off now!"
"I can't! It-it's stuck!"
"Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at myparent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!"
"All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think."
"Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legsas wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!"
"Sorry! Sorry."
"Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!"
"Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in thedoorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)"
"(pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!"
"I'm over here big guy."
"(turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are!(Starts dancing.) I scared you!"
"(laughing) You did look like an idiot."
"Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Rememberwhen Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternutbuash?""
"Yeah that's the same."
"That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving."
"Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't evenknow that happened. So which one was it?"
"Which one?"
"Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story."
"Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is whatThanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians."
"Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!"
"Monica! I think Rachel's here!"
"I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One WithThe Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. Shegoes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!"
"Not for me. Chip and I broke up!"
"Oh, why? Why? What happened?"
"Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip wasgoing to come over…"
"Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower."
"Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It"
"Hi Rachel!"
"Happy Thanksgiving!"
"You too sweethart!"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Oh my!"
"Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!"
"Ross! (Wanting to be introduced.)"
"Oh, this is Monica."
"Hi, I'm Ross's little sister."
"(seeing her) Okay."
"I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so Ihope you're hungry."
"Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgivingfood."
"Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then."
"Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheesefor dinner."
"Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in."
"dammit! (Runs off.)"
"So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know sinceI've been away at college."
"Oh! No, not really."
"Well, that's cool. So did… (She walks away from him and he shuts up.)"
"Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that"
"I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with NancyBranson."
"Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They arejust silly. (Ross is overhearing this.) Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!"
"Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack werelooking for."
"Call them mom and dad you loser!"
"(in a high pitched voice) Monica!"
"Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?"
"Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef."
"Okay!"
"Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slutwas all a rumor so Chip"
"Oh that's so great!"
"I know!"
"Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'lltell me everything."
"Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, wealready kinda did it once y'know."
"I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna"
"I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promisedthat-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!"
"So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe playher that song we wrote last week."
"Emotional Knapsack?"
"Yeah."
"Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we'regonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez."
"Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m gonna be out with herall night."
"Dude, don't do that too me!"
"All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind."
"No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night withyour fat sister."
"Hey!"
"(holding two pies) Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? Idon't have any more room left in the fridge."
"No. No, thank you!"
"Well Judy, you did it! She's"
"I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!"
"Well, I do."
"I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed thestage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!"
"Oh, I can't believe you called her fat."
"I can't believe you let George Michael slap you."
"I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry."
"Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about."
"Yes, it was!"
"No, it wasn't. It was actually the…"
"(interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready forChristmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!"
"Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!"
"We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!"
"Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'knowwhatever."
"So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again."
"Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychologybuilding."
"(entering) Hi Rachel."
"Oh hi!"
"Wow, love your new nose!"
"Jack."
"What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?(He starts to show her as the doorbell rings.)"
"I'll get it."
"No, God! Please, let me! (Runs out.)"
"Hey!"
"Hey. (To his parents) Happy Thanksgiving!"
"(To Chandler) God, your hair sure is different!"
"Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid weused to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)"
"So uh, where's Monica?"
"She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel,and the boy who hates Thanksgiving."
"Hi, Chandler."
"Oh my God!"
"What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (Sheturns around making sure he gets a good look.)"
"You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!"
"Dude!"
"Sorry!"
"Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want tohear about is Ross's new girlfriend."
"Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart.And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She playsfor both teams!"
"So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner."
"Dude!"
"Sorry."
"(entering) Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him backfor calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!"
"Well it didn't!"
"What?!"
"Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heartis not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got himback, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and thenI'm going to point at him and laugh!"
"Okay,"
"How?"
"Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex."
"What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weightso that I can give my flower to someone like him!"
"Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna evertake it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're justgonna make him think that you are."
"Yeah."
"Yeah."
"And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock thedoor and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!"
"Then, you will"
"Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?"
"Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turnsyou on."
"What do you mean?"
"Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!(She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good againstmy cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring itdown to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him."
"(excited) I can do that!"
"Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler)Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)"
"Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous macand cheese like last year."
"Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides tofollow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni andcheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek."
"Okay."
"Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds thembetween her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-andhold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm,and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up aknife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder)and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have anyexposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and thebox between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)"
"Are you all right?"
"Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that—(She drops the box andin a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flipsthrough the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)"
"What do we got here?"
"Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot."
"Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is!Severed toe, you"
"It says here that the knife went right through your shoe."
"Of course it did. They're made of wicker."
"Did you bring the toe?"
"Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of herpurse and hands it to the doctor.)"
"(opening it) Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and—(Stopssuddenly.)"
"What?! What is it?"
"You brought a carrot."
"What?"
"This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot."
"You brought a carrot?!"
"Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen."
"God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!"
"It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound."
"Without my toe?! I need my toe!"
"Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your"
"Oh, I'm not falling for that one!"
"That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!"
"I didn't"
"That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!"
"I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!"
"Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (Hestorms out.)"
"Chandler! (Follows him out.)"
"(To Joey) Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that."
"You're a dork."
"I can't believe this."
"Chandler, I said I was sorry."
"Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that criedall the way home! I"
"Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?"
"Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)"
"Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I’m happy allthe time!"
"Nice try."
"Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)"
"Look, Monica…"
"Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)"
"This is not going to work."
"I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)"
"You are so great! I love you!"
"What?"
"Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, Ijust stopped talking!"
"You said you loved me! I can't believe this!"
"No I didn't!"
"Yes, you did!"
"No I didn't!"
"You love me!"
"No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!"
