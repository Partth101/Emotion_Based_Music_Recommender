"(starts to imagine it) I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way."

"Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay."
"And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldn’t bedating me, that’s for sure."

"Thanks."
"Yeah. Y’know, the hazelnut actually not a nut,it’s a seed."
"(not impressed) Wow!!"
"Can anyone else name a well known seed that’s beenmasquerading as a nut?"

"Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing wasfunny, just not ""
"Y’know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital."
"Okay."
"(kisses her) Okay."
"Bye."
"Bye-bye. (Gets up to leave.) Oh uh, by the way, the answeris, the Brazil nut. (Exits.)"
"Was his question what’s more boring than him?"
"Hey man, look sorry about that"
"Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride."
"Really?"
"Ehh."
"Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars haveassistants right?"
"That’s an idea! (To Chandler) Hey, if I hired an assistant,would-would you take money from her?"
"No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all ofyour fan mail and stuff!"
"That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that!"
"I could use the money; it could give me time to write."
"Oh right great! Welcome aboard!"
"Okay!"
"All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t needany assistance in there, take a break!"
"All right!"

"You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!"
"And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)"

"Oh my God!"
"Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would beexcited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks."
"Most people don’t like their jobs, I"
"Honey, having a heart attack is nature’s way of telling you to slowit down."
"I always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way oftelling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But you’re not gonna die. I mean, you are"
"Let’s take a walk. (They start to leave.) Y’know maybe youshould consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine! (They exit.)"
"(To Ross) So what’s going on with you?"
"Well umm, I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay."

"Yeah."
"How long has it been since you had sex?"
"Well, last weekend…"
"Oh that’s not so bad."

"(awestruck, then not) Isn’t that a line from the show?!"
"Uh, yeah but uh, (In Drake’s voice) I may have said those thingsbefore but, I never truly meant them. Until now."

"Like what?"

"What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!"
"But, I put some honey in it."
"She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she?"
"No, the doctors say it may kill her."
"What are you two girls whispering about over there?!"
"(To Ross) But"
"Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that youshould start think about getting a different job."
"Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!(Points at Ross.)"
"Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heartattacks at 31."
"I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do?"
"Well, you used to like playing the guitar."
"Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!"
"Uh, what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you aheart attack."
"Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross nakedpeople for chump change—ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!"
"Ohh, I mean it’s just so realistic!"
"I know. (Joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls onpolls. You’ll have to see it to know what I mean.) Yeah, his name is Pat."
"Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)"
"(climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?"
"Oh, I probably shouldn’t—so I will! (Joey starts making herrefill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! It’s like it’sraining!"
"Pretty cool, huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in thereand it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong."
"Umm, can I use your bathroom?"
"It’s uh, right through there. (Points.)"
"Okay. (Starts to go.) God y’know, if someone told me a week agothat I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment…"
"Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it?"
"Yeah, it sure is!"
"I hope you’re hungry, we’re starting with oysters. Andy’know what they say about oysters, don’t you?"
"They have parasites?"
"No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac."
"What people?"
"People! People say it! Come here! (She grabs him and kisses him.)"
"So oysters, huh?"
"And then we’re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous.Something we can eat, with our hands."
"Y’know, it’s funny, but when we were studying communicablediseases…"
"No-no-no, no! It’s sensual!"
"Ohh! Didn’t know! Okay!"
"Okay! (They kiss again and his beeper goes off.) Ohhh no!"
"I’m sorry sweetie, it’s the hospital. The food looks great,maybe save me some?"
"I can’t promise anything. (She starts to dig in.)"
"We’re really gonna do this, huh?"
"Looks like it."
"Y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back outat… (A knock on the door interrupts him.)"
"(jumping up to get it) I got it!"
"Okay."
"(opening the door) Susan! Hi! (Who’d you think it was gonna be?)"
"Hey! (They hug.)"
"Thank you so much for coming."
"Oh, I wouldn’t miss it for the world."
"I’m-I’m Ross by the way."
"(not taking her eyes off Carol) Hello Ross. (Takes off her coat and handsit to him.) I love what you’ve done with this space."
"Thank you so much."
"How hot is this?!"
"I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger."
"Yeah, me too."
"Well, I could make it seem like he’s here. (Imitates him.)"Here’s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn’t add the secondcous until 1979." (Mumbles something further.)"
"Stop it!! That’s not funny!!"
"Okay."
"I’m sorry, okay? It just—tonight was supposed to bey’know, it was supposed to be a big deal."
"What was tonight?"
"You don’t want to know what tonight was."
"Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?"
"Well, tonight was—was going to be my first time."
"With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monicashrugs.) Oh my God!"
"All right relax Mr. I’ve Had Sex Four Times!"
"Four different women! I’ve had sex way more times!"
"How many?"
"Nine."
"I was just waiting for the perfect guy."
"Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfectguy?"
"No. He’s not a horrible guy."
"Hey that’s what I tell girls about me."
"Chandler, I’m gonna die a virgin!"
"No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happenfor you."
"Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?"
"Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)"
"I was kidding."
"So was I."
"Joey, you’re such an amazing actor! (He smiles.) How do you knowwhere Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?"
"Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, Ipretty much have to make it up on my own."
"Wow! Tell me something Joey—(She falls off the couch)—Whoa! Ijust fell right off the couch there."
"Yeah you did."
"Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.)"
"Here you go. Let me ask you a question."
"Yeah?"
"When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?"
"Wow! I can’t, I can’t feel my hands."
"Come, come here."
"We can’t do this."
"No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?"
"Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot ofpressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and Iwouldn’t want to disappoint you."
"Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you’rehorrible, how would I know?"
"I do like that."
"It’s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!"
"Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be fortonight, right?"
"Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping outanother friend. (Points at herself.)"
"Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!"
"Noo!! Okay!!"
"Okay! (They both get up.)"
"Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?"
"I have some moves."
"I have no moves. (He moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backsaway.) Okay, whatcha doin’ there?! (Giggles.) Oh y’know what? I’m sorry,this is just too weird."
"Yeah, let’s just forget it."
"What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)"
"Okay!"
"Oh yeah."
"Chandler?"
"(sexily) Yeah?"

"Yeah."
"(groans) Oh God. Oh I can’t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throwup!"
"Well he actually saw you a little bit too."
"Noo! Oh God we did—we didn’t, we didn’t uhh…"
"No! No! No, not after seeing that."
"God I’m just a horrible person."
"Wh-why?"
"Because I’m married. That’s right, I am a married woman! And Icame to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck!"
"That’s ridiculous! I’m not a "Star," just a regularfamous actor."
"Yeah and I’m a horrible, horrible person."
"Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the showwhen-when Caprice was dying and she gave me…"
"The ring from the cave, yeah."
"Wow! Uh okay, well uh… (He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out thering.)"
"(seeing the ring and gasping) Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!"
"Sure! As long as they don’t find out you can keep whatever you want!And I want you to have it."
"No! No-no-no…"
"Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that"
"But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for herbrother."
"Look, do you want the ring or not?!"
"Yeah!"
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Look at you! You’re up!"
"All right!"
"I thought I’d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water?I’ll be back soon."
"Whoa-whoa-whoa! You’re not gonna use the pay phone to call work, areya?"
"No. I’ve learned my lesson."
"Let’s go! Come on! Move it! (Grabs her coat.) Come on! (To an oldman who’s holding her shoes and briefcase.) Shoes! Briefcase! (Takes them both.)Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder. (She leaves.)"
