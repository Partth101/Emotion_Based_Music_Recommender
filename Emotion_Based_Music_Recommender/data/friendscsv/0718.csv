"What kinda noise?"
"Just a high pitched intimidating noise."
"But like how?"
"Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it soundedsomething like this. (He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesn’t know what tomake of it.) Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that’s uh, that’s all fortoday. (Everyone starts to get up.) Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?"
"Yes sir."

"Well I’m sorry but, that-that’s really not my problem."
"I’m in love with you."
"Well that brings me in the loop a little."
"You see, that’s why I did so bad on this test. I’m having ahard time concentrating. When you’re up there (Points to the podium) and you’reteaching and your face gets all serious…you look so good. (In a sexy voice) You wearthat tight little turtleneck sweater…"
"Okay! (Walks away from him.) Umm, I uh, I’m your teacher. I’msorry, you’re-you’re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may bewritten on the backs of some of these chairs."
"Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!"
"Really? (Looks.) My God, he’s really cute."
"Go for it."
"Phoebe, I’m engaged!"
"I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is inan accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover tosatisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill."
"Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’mengaged. (Points to her ring.)"
"Well you should be embarrassed. (Leaves.)"
"I did, but that was really fun."
"(pretending to be an announcer) And the winner is…Joey Tribbiani! (Hethen gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using abottle of maple syrup as the award.) Oh… Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, Ididn’t prepare a speech. But umm, I’d like to thank (Rachel enters quietly) myparents, who’ve always been there for me. I’d also like to thank my friends,Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel…"
"I’m fourth! (Joey is startled.) Look at you with your little maplesyrup award!"
"Yeah may-maybe you don’t tell anyone about this."
"What? No! It’s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoobottle."
"Really?"
"Yeah."
"What award are you practicing for?"

"Oh, hey listen! The Soapie’s called today and I also get to presentan award."
"Ohh that’s great!"
"Yeah!"
"So you’ll definitely get onstage, even if you don’t win."
"(confused) What you-you don’t think I’m gonna win?"
"Well of course I do! But y’know, favorite returning character is atough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation."
"Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it’s just…I’venever even been nominated before! I want it so much."
"Well Joey, you’ll probably get it. But you should probablyyour-your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wannalook disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’ssorta like… (Does it, you’ll have to see it.)"
"Hey! (Likes it.)"
"Y’know?"
"You practice losing the"
"Oh no, at the"
"Ah."
"Oh hey!"
"Hey! How’d your date go with Jake?"
"Oh, great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night andthen every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair andtouch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)"
"Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly."
"(laughs) All I could think of was y’know, "Is he gonna kissme? Is he gonna kiss me?""
"And did he?"
"I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickeyspeaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)"
"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it."
"I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinkstoday and I’ve only had six."
"Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out withChandler. Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again am I?"
"You sound like a guy."
"No, a guy would be saying, "I’m never gonna get to sleep withanyone else." Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things thatI’d be giving up! I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again."
"You’ll have a last kiss."
"Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?"
"Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?"
"There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me."
"Whoa!"
"(entering from her room) Whoa what?"
"Ross has a boyfriend."
"I do-I do"
"Really?"
"Yeah! I don’t know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid.What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe? (Racheland Joey both look at him.)"
"Not right now."
"It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm."
"Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once andit was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every timehe looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and inlove."
"Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack."
"Yeah."
"How’d you get over that teacher?"
"I didn’t. I got under him."
"(To Ross) Problem solved."
"Bye Phoebe."
"Okay bye. (They kiss.)"
"All right. Bye. (Backs out the door.)"
"Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-byeat the door so as not to flaunt our new love."
"Phoebe, it’s okay. You don’t have to tip toe around me.I-I’ve been thinking about it and umm, y’know what? I’m okay about nothaving that new relationship feeling…"
"(yelling through the window to Phoebe) I miss you already!!"
"(yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.)"
"See? That’s what I mean. I mean"
"Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger."
"(To Rachel) This is it! This is my category."
"I know! My God! Do you have your speech?"
"Yeah, I got my speech!"
"Do you got your gracious loser face?"
"Yeah. (Does it.)"
"Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!"
"Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?"
"On TV?! Yeah!"
"‘Kay!"
"…in the category of Favorite Returning Male Character thenominees are: John Wheeler from"
"What the?! (Joey pounds the table and starts yelling at Rachel, and whichis drowned out by applause. Rachel is desperately trying to tell Joey that he’s on TVright now. He finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)"
"(angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated forthis award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his headin disgust.) The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from"
"Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!"
"Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won! (He whips outthe award for Best Supporting Actress that he accepted for Jessica.)"
"Oh my God you stole her award!"
"No-no! No, I’m accepting it on her behalf. (He puts it up above theTV to display it.)"
"Joey I don’t think you know what behalf means."
"Sure I do! It’s a verb! As in, "I behalfin’ it!""
"Joey, you have got to take this back!"
"But why?! I should’ve won one and I really want it and shedidn’t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a"
"(looking at the award) No! Joey!"
"Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of‘em."
"Do you really want an award you didn’t win?"
"No! I want an award I did win! But nobody’s giving me any of those!Plus—Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there (Points to the TV) right? When people comeover they’ll see it and they’ll think I won it."
"Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!"
"I can scratch that right off."
"Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don’twant to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonnawin one of these for real and"

"All right? (He sets the award down.) Thank you."
"I’ll take it back tomorrow."
"Thank you."
"(opening his door) If I can’t have it you can’t have it! (Rachelwalks away angrily.)"
"Professor Geller?"
"(turning towards him) Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?"
"I know I didn’t do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kindahoping you could change my grade."
"And why exactly would I do that? (Goes back to writing on the board.)"
"Because I’m in love with you."
"(turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) What?!"
"Yeah, I’m all…in love with you and stuff. So could you changemy grade?"
"No!"
"Well why not you changed Ned’s grade!"
"Well that’s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love withme!"
"No he’s not! He’s totally yanking your chain! He’s donethis with three other teachers!"
"What?"
"He’s got a girlfriend!"
"I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade."
"I know! It’s awful. I love you."
"Have you seen Chandler?"
"No. Why?"
"‘Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I’mnot gonna have and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do about it."
"Okay, don’t sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowherearound so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy’s cute. (Points to a guysitting behind Monica.)"
"Phoebe! Come on I’m serious! I just got to talk to him about allthis."
"No that is the"
"Why?"
"Because you’re marrying him!"
"You gotta help me out here Pheebs."
"All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really beenmarried, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fearsor anxieties about a relationship, do"
"So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guyI’m gonna spend the rest of my life with?"
"That is correct! Yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff andput it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight."
"Your mother told you this?"
"Yes!"
"The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when youwere 13?"
"Oh my God! You’re right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tellChandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also meanputting out doesn’t get you love? (Monica is shocked.)"
"I cannot believe I’m gonna meet Jessica Ashley!"

"Uh listen, here’s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. (Hands it toher.)"

"Well, that-that-that’s it? You’re gonna, you’re gonna putit on your self or anything?"
"No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you’llexcuse me. (She exits.)"
"(To Rachel) Take it back?"
"Absolutely."
"Y-y-yeah! (As they start to leave, Rachel pauses and steals a vase withflowers in it.) Yeah you do. (They exit.)"
"Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you wouldlike to talk about or share?"
"Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big"
"You’re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared atall?"
"Kinda. They’re really big."
"Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re nevergonna be with anybody new again?"
"What?"
"Just, I love you so much. Just…It’s just sometimes it bothersme that I’m never gonna have that feeling. Y’know when you meet someone for thefirst time and it’s new and exciting? Y’know that rush?"
"No. No, see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostlypanic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating."
"Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you thatyou’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?"
"Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I’m afraid evenmore sweating."
"Even with me?"
"I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of ourrelationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna betogether for the rest of our lives."
"Really?"
"Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts,I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sportsdrink."

"Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you toknow that I’m changing your grade back."
"What?! Why?"
"‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’snot gonna work."
"I’m not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude."
"Y’know what? I-I’m not even gonna talk about this. Okay? Thislittle thing is over. I"
"Rach?"
"I’ll be out in a second."
