"Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watchingfootball, you could help."
"We will. (they don’t move)"
"Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles."
"No Mon,"
"Every year."
"Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of thesethings. (just as she sits down)."
"Halftime."
"Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a littlethree on three going?"
"Oh! That would be sooo much fun!"
"Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever."
"Great, you can cover Chandler."
"No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t really wanna play."
"Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up."
"That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanutclusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that Idon’t have goals!"
"Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, youget some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’tplay, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on."
"Yeah, all right, I’ll play."
"Yay!!"
"Let’s do it! Ross?"
"What?"
"Do you wanna play football?"
"Um, Monica and I aren’t supposed to play football."
"Says who? Your mom?"
"Yeah."
"Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch footballgame called the ‘Geller Bowl.’"
"No, no, no, you say that proudly."
"Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind’vecompetitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose."
"It was soo"
"To score the winning touchdown, by the way."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdowndidn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nosebreaking."
"(to Chandler and Joey) I won the game."
"Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?"
"Um, there was a Geller Cup?"
"Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said,‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophyand.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw itin the lake."
"And was the curse lifted?"
"Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football everagain."
"Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it’sbeen twelve years."
"Can I see you for a second?"
"(shouting) Once!!"
"All right, we’re gonna play."
"But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, becausemy Mom won’t let me cross the street."
"Okay. Let’s bring it in."
"Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me."
"Here you go. (throws her the ball)"
"(knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in theface."
"All right, we have to pick captains."
"And then Tineals."
"Okay, so how do we decide that?"
"Well, why don’t we just bunny up."
"What?"
"(holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbitears with their fingers.) Bunny!"
"Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied firstso that means I get to pick first. Joey."
"Thank you."
"Monica, I’m your best friend."
"Sweetie, don’t worry you’ll get picked. Chandler."
"Ross!"
"Phoebe."
"Sweetie, now I pick you."
"You don’t"
"Okay. All right. So let’s see, let’s play from the trash can, tothe lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we’ll kick off."
"All right people listen, I’ve got exactly twenty-eight minutesbefore I have to baste again."
"Wow! Just like in the pros."
"Huddle up."
"(to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here."
"Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle."
"Okay."
"Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?"
"Okay, Phoebe you know what you’re doing right?"
"Yeah."
"Okay, Joey’s gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block."
"What’s block?"
"Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you’re doing?"
"I thought you meant in life."
"Break."
"The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball butkicks Ross’s foot instead.)"
"Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!"
"Sorry. I’m sorry. Y'know what, we’re just gonna throw it."
"I got it. (catches the ball)"

"Score!! 7 to nothing!"
"(coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Are you okay?"
"Come on, let’s go!"
"Losers walk!"
"Yeah, losers talk!"
"No, no, no, actually losers rhyme."
"(coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and putshis hands between Ross’s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up andlooks at him) You wanna go shotgun?"
"Yeah!"
"(from the shotgun) Hike!"
"One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi."
"Over here!"
"(proud of her self) I almost caught that one!"
"Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7."
"Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to theright. Okay. Break!"

"Well, I said it loud."
"It is okay, if I stay and watch?"
"Yeah! Why don’t you stick around. You can sit rightthere."
"Well, that went well."
"I think so."
"Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number."
"Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for itmyself, y'know."
"Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part ofthat whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about."
"Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I’ll let you haveher."
"Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’tI wouldn’t have a shot?"

"Math!! You’re giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forgetabout it, you go for the girl, we’ll see who gets her."
"Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. Andsweetie.."
"Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it’s like all I’m doing isrunning back and forth from the huddle."
"Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?"
"Can I see that for second."
"Yeah."
"Okay. Hut! Hike!"
"Fumble!"
"What the hell’s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey."
"Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math."
"All right, that’s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. Butnow, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself."
"Hey! Well, I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Orsomething about you that’s mean!"
"All right, come on guys, let’s go! Tie score, and we’rerunnin’ out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monicathrows the ball to Phoebe.)"

"Before!!"
"Now, does it really matter?"
"Yes!!"
"Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?"
"Oh Pheebs, that’s great. It doesn’t count."
"Does so count!"
"Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater."
"Oh my God!"
"Y'know what, that’s fine, maybe you haven’t grown up, but Ihave."
"Oh-ho, okay."
"Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)"
"Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, goahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win."
"Woo-yay!!"
"No! Listen, I’m not gonna go through this with you again, okay.Just once I wanna beat when you can’t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or thefact that you thought you were getting mono. Let’s just call this, tie score andit’s halftime."
"Okay, first of all, I don’t play with cheaters, and second of all,you know I had swollen glands!!"
"Y'know what? I’ll think you’ll play."
"Oh really! Why is that?"
"Because the winner gets this!"
"The Geller Cup."
"Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?"
"Yeah."
"Okay, good."
"Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!"
"When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, Iswam into the lake and fished it out."
"That cup is mine!"
"No it’s not! You want it, you’re gonna have to win it!"
"All right, so are we not having dinner at all?"
"Come on Phoebe, let’s go! Come on, it’s time to get serious,huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game."
"It’s hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl."
"All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be ableto focus?"
"What are you gonna do?"
"All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I’lltake care of the rest."
"Okay."
"Break!"
"Here you go!"
"Chandler! Chandler!"
"(to Margha) Hi."
"Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don’t see that everyday, doya?"
"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?"
"What?! I just touched him and he went over."
"Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough."
"I love this game!!"
"Hey, where’d you get that?"
"I went really long."
"Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!"
"It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pickfirst, so you got the better team."
"You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’rewinning because I’m better than you."
"Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I’llprove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win thegame."
"What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica,because I’m only down by three touchdowns."
"Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose toa bunch of girls."
"Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you’re with me."
"I can not believe your trading me!!"
"Come on Rach, come on. Let’s see what’s it like to be on awinning team for a change."
"Are you gonna let me play?"
"All right then."
"(coming over) The game is over, we eat now?"
"No-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switchingteams."
"Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it’s better if we’reon the same team."
"Right. Okay, let’s play. Let’s go."
"No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?"
"Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania."
"And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near theNetherlands, right?"
"Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place wherePeter Pan and Tinker Bell come from."
"Oh, my."
"Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let’s play some ball,guys."
"Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I’m not playing with this guy, now."
"Fine with me."
"Okay, y'know what, let’s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi,which of my boys do you like?"
"What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?"
"Which do I like?"
"Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to yourwindmill..."
"Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird,I would have to say, Chandler."
"Yes!!"
"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn’t understand thequestion."
"Well, you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her."
"I’m sorry, Joey, that is my chose."
"You hear that! That is her chose, mister I’ll let you have her! Iwin! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)"
"I’m now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one."
"Wh-what?"
"I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye."
"Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex."
"Y'know what, it doesn’t matter, ‘cause she picked me. Me!From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching"
"Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have notime, and we are losing, we are losing to girls."
"We’re not gonna lose to girls."

"This sucks, I was just up by that much!"
"Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries."
"We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, justthink about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV whileyou’re making out..."
"Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!"
"Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let’s kill‘um!"
"Yeah!!! Kill ‘um!!!"
"All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know howare we gonna beat three boys?"
"All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we’re downby two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing aslow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long."
"No! Come on! Don’t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me."
"Honey, there’s a reason."
"God, I’m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would youlet me throw, come on this is my game too."
"Come on Mon, let her throw the ball."
"All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I’ll pitch it to you, you throwit down field to Phoebe. All right. Break."
"Thank you! Break!"
"Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!"
"One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!"
"I’m so sorry! Are you okay?"
"No! I’m not okay!"
"I’m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn’t knowwhat to do."

"(on the verge of tears) Okay."
"Break!"
"(in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!"
"Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts atthat pole, so you’re five feet short, so we win!"
"Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobodytagged Rachel, then isn’t the play still going."
"Let go! Let go!"
"Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!"
"Guys! Guys! Come on! It’s Thanksgiving, it’s not importantwho wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Notyou! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!"
"Ow!!"
"We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there’s a likeleague we could join or something."
"Isn’t there a national football league."
"Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights."
"Oh shoot! I work Monday nights."
"Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?"
"When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in."
"Let go!"
"No! You let go!"
"No!"
"How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?"
"I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough."
"Hey! It’s starting to snow."
"Gimme the this!"
"Let go!"
