"Y’know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna datesome random guy from your work."
"It’s not random, it’s Bob."
"It’s probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe hedoesn’t like the way I dress—No that can’t be it. It’s really gotta bethe smart thing. Oh I’m"
"No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? BecauseI asked him to."
"You asked him too?!"
"Hm-mmm."
"Why?!"
"Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…"
"I don’t understand, do you want to go out with Ross?"
"No."
"You don’t want him, but you don’t want me to have him?"
"(changing the subject) Y’know Bob in Human Resources…"
"Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart Iwas! (Gasps) You had me doubting my fashion sense!"
"Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross!There’s a million other guys out there, you just…"
"Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do."
"I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what"
"Why are you so jealous of me?"
"Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you beinga brat! Wanting what you can’t have!"
"Can’t have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can’t have is"
"All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!"

"(noticing the bag Joey’s carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?"
"Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kindyou’re gonna like."

"Guys, what’s going on?"
"(holds up the movie) Phoebe’s a porn star!"
"What?!!"
"Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer."
"Oh my God!"
"That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that?"
"Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker."
"And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead ofhim to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. (Theyall kinda look at him.)"
"Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this.Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always beensomewhat of a question mark."
"This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know shehad such a terrible childhood."
"Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn."
"Yes, but you are dead inside."
"All right well, I’d better take that back."
"Wh-what, why?"
"We can’t watch that! I mean that’s Phoebe!"
"Yeah you’re right, we can’t—we shouldn’t watch this."
"Absolutely not."
"(hands the tape back to Joey, but doesn’t let him grab it)Y’know maybe a little bit!"
"Probably just the first half."
"No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well,I’m not gonna watch it!"
"Yeah! Good for you Joe!"
"Yeah."
"Ah, I thought I’d find you here, Nasforatool."
"Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?"
"Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the otherway around."
"Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?"
"Her ankle is what you’re watching?"
"Well it’s hard to tell… (Rachel gets up to get a closer look,only she’s having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving."
"She’s just doing her job!"
"(sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV) You sick bastards!"
"Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t…Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!"
"Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!"
"(entering) Hey! What’s up? (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am Idoing?!!"
"Hey sweetie!"
"Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under thecouch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)"
"(picking up the book)"
"There’s no back to this couch!"
"Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff."
"Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of thosestories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all deadinside."
"Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if youcan’t cry, I love you."
"Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest."
"Stop it!"
"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married,we’re up at the altar and I’m like this. (Makes a bored face.)"
"I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.(Points to her heart.)"
"Yeah?"
"Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it toyou in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take himto college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing,it won’t matter to me."
"Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then."
"And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing outmy eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I willalways be with you," and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’llbe crying a river inside."
"Aww, I love you so…"
"What is wrong with you?!!!"
"What?!"
"What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you anote from the beyond!"
"So you didn’t mean any of that?!"
"No you robot!!"
"You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to… (Opens thedoor to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that’s just a little gameI play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they’ve really taken a liking to me.(Quickly looks out to see if they’re watching.) Uhhwhat’s-what’s-what’s the matter?"
"Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I knowwe’re not supposed to see each other anymore and I’m okay with that, it’sjust that I don’t know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk toabout it."
"Of course, what happened? (Lets her in.)"
"(entering) I don’t want to talk about it."
"Okay, umm…"
"But you know what might really cheer me up?"
"What?"
"Seeing some more of your super-cool slides."
"Wow! Really?!"
"Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all thedifferent kinds of sand."
"Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get theprojector and my notes!"
"Oh great! Thanks Ross, you’re such a good friend!"
"Ohh!"
"Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere."
"No, I haven’t."
"Well, is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’sactually seen her."
"Who is it?"
"It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!"
"Hey!"
"(seeing her dress) Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies."
"No I’m not."
"We’re still rolling!"
"You’re making one right now!"
"Let’s go Phoebe!"
"And-"
"Yeah, can I help you with something?"
"Phoebe, come on!"
"Look, I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her."
"Y’know, twin stuff is always a real big seller."
"What?!"
"Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars."
"No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! (Yells intothe apartment) And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you (points tosomeone) with that! (Storms away.)"
"Slides are almost ready."
"Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!"
"Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen."
"Oh great! (Goes to get it as the phone rings.)"
"(answering it) Hello?"
"(on phone)"
"O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’rejust talking."
"Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to getback at me!"
"So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’thave anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I puton a"
"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!"
"Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to youlater. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.)Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me."
"So? (Kisses him passionately.)"
"Hey!"

"So, I just came from the company Ursula works for."
"Oh no, not you too!"
"No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were alot of them."
"Nice!"
"Um-mmm,"
"That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still thinkyou’re a porn star?"
"Oh no! No! I know how to handle it."
"You do?"
"Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is tryingto remember where he’s seen her before.) (To him) You’re trying to figure outwhere you know me from? All right, I’ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? (He triesto rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (ToJoey) See?"

"Umm, she kissed me."
"What?! You kissed!"
"(To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy."
"(To Chandler) Shhhh!!!"
"Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?"
"Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy notto kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!"
"Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it.I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…"
"Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Letme give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)"
"Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped thekissing."
"Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouthlong enough to tell me that."
"Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothingcould ever happen with us!"
"What?!"
"No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us,again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and shegot mad and broke my projector."
"Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kickshim.)"
"You’re welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)"
"Oh my God! Are-are you crying?"
"(crying hysterically) I just don’t see why those two can’twork things out!"
"All right, I’m leaving! Because I’m not going to spend one moreday with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That’s you Rachel!"
"Yeah, I got that."
"(To Ross) And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?"
"You take care Jill."
"(happily) Okay, see ya! (Exits.)"
"Bye-bye-e!"
