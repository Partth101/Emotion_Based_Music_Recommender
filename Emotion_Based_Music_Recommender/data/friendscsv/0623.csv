"Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? Ican’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page)Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!"
"Now, have you told anyone else?"
"No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t wantMonica to find out."
"You told me."
"Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my bestfriends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’tbeen on the toilet."
"Me too."
"Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.)"
"Hey."
"Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?"
"Oh all right."
"Yeah, coffeehouse."
"Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go."
"Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place."
"How rude."
"Oh, I’m sorry. You wanna bite? (Holds his piece out for him.)"
"So how are things going with Paul?"
"Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, Iwish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings."
"That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of picklesthat won’t open."
"So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang hishead against a table?"
"No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out ofsomeone."
"(entering) Hi honey."
"Hi!"
"(To Rachel) Watch this."
"(To Rachel) How are you?"
"(To Phoebe) Okay."
"Hi Paul!"
"Hi Phoebe."
"So how are things going with you?"
"Can’t complain."
"(whispering) Come on."
"Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.)"
"(To Ross) Hey!"
"Hi!"
"Ross!"
"Great to see you!"
"Good to see you too!"
"How you doing?"
"Good. Bye! (Starts to leave.)"
"Okay! You take care!"
"Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us offbefore?"
"Yeah! That was so weird, huh?"
"Phoebe, why’d you do it?"
"I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad atyou!"
"What?! Why?!"
"Please, I think you know why."
"I can’t think of anything."
"Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper."
"Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to thatKnicks game a couple of weeks ago?"
"Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?"
"I guess it could."
"Well then I think that’s it."
"Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-Iwish he would just tell me the truth."
"Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his headunder hot water and bang his head against a table."
"Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?"
"Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell meabout your day."
"It was fine."
"Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?"
"I’m thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress."
"Yeah that’s great Paul, but y’know I wanna knowwhat—(Puts her hands on his shoulders)—Wow, those are really great! I just wannaknow what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y’know they say thatstill waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours."
"Are you talking about having sex?"
"No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-likeyour childhood! Tell me about your childhood!"
"Normal."
"Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painfultime! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your handin warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag."
"Nope! That never happened to me!"
"Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway,umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?"
"Nope."
"All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give mesomething. Anything!"
"Okay."
"Okay."
"Okay."
"All right."
"When I was six years old."
"Hm-mmm."
"I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plasticchicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was apretty tough year."
"That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you alittle better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go. (Gets up toleave, but Paul doesn’t move.)"
"It was horrible. They called me chicken boy."
"Oh!"
"And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn’t really afight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a littlescare right here (points to it) you can see it."
"Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is reallygreat that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’sbeautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?"
"Oh, I couldn’t eat now."
"What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung PaoChicken!"
"Chicken? (Pointing to himself.) Chicken boy!"
"My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! Iwouldn’t do that!"
"Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too andI can’t find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and startspointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers iswatching him.) It’s a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)"
"Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you dosomething different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know?Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one upfrom the display in the corner."
"Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this."
"Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her thisgorgeous piece of weaponry?"
"Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another displaycounter.) Oh, this one’s nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh,kind sir? Can I see this one?"
"(coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is,this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this fromhere on out."
"Can I help you?"
"Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please."
"Or not, whatever."
"This ring is from the 1920s, it’s a one and a half caratdiamond with sapphires on either side."
"Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and askme to marry you?"
"Okay. (Holds out the ring, deadpan.) Will you marry me?"
"(choking up) Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How muchis it?"
"Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much"
"8,600."
"We will give you $10."
"(angrily) Are you interested in this ring?!"
"Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000."
"Okay, I can let it go at eight."
"We stand firm at $10."
"(ignoring her) How would you like to pay?"
"Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but Ileft my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring."
"Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen, I’m sorry about before. Do you haveanything her for $10."
"Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills. (Holds them upfrom his pocket.)"
"I’ll give you $1 for them."
"Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?"
"No."
"Remember? You-you were eating pizza."
"Yeah."
"Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him aticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago."
"Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is alwaysmooching off of us!"
"Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up,y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game andinvite him."
"Oh wow that’s a great idea! And"
"(handing them the bill) Here you go."
"Oh. (Starts to get his money)"
"Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. (Hands GuntherChandler’s card.) Y’know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just—I don’t getChandler. Y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t getall upset."
"All the time?"
"All the time!"
"Oh my God! Oh my God!!"
"Still crying?"
"Like a"
"Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And oneof them is sex."
"What’s the other one?"
"I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’mjust saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking."
"Oh that’s right. You’re the talker. (They both reflect on thatbriefly) Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buyhim some more tissues."
"Oh, we have some…"
"No you don’t!"
"Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara. (The male jewelerhands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think, toomuch?"
"A tad."
"Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (Hehands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Something’smissing. It’s not… Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out."
"(to the female jeweler) Where’s the 1920s princess cut ring."
"I just sold it to that gentleman. (Points to the one walking outthe store.)"
"Oh my God!! (She runs after him, but sets of the security system, whichlocks the store’s door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No!What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)"
"Rachel?"
"No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)"
"(acting manly to try and cover up his crying) Okay. Chandler, did your dadever hug you?"
"No, did he hug you?!"
"No! No! It’s just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad."
"Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads."
"Hey Chandler?"
"Yeah?"
"Would you…….Would you hug me?"
"I’m a little busy here Paul."
"That’s exactly what my dad used to say! (Starts to breakdown again.)"
"Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugsChandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)"
"Five more seconds."
"Okay! (Pushes him away.)"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Joey! (Goes over and hugs Joey and picks him off of his feet.)"
"Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (Motions to Chandler, "What’s goingon?") Hi, Paul is it? (Paul nods yes and still hugging Joey.)"
"Do you have my credit card?"
"Yes, it’s in my… In…in my pocket. (Paul hasn’t droppedhim yet.) (Chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) My back pocket! My back pocket!"
"Thank God! (Grabs his card.)"
"Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight."
"Oh, I can’t go."
"Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and… Paulprobably…"
"Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)"
"Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go withthe one I picked first."
"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!"
"What?"
"Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they (pointsto the jeweler) put me in jail!"
"They put you in jail?"
"The little jail between the doors!"
"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
"I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monicanever even saw the other ring."
"Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps."
"Maybe it was the guy."
"It was the ring!"
"Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?"
"No! He blew us off!"
"What?!"
"I know!"
"I can’t believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? I’m alittle mad at him now."
"Can I tell you something? Me too."
"Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry,well maybe we don’t talk to him"
"Ooooh! Freeze him out."
"That’s right!"
"I like it!"
"Eh? We’ll show him!"
"From now on, it’s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. (They shakehands.) Okay! We’re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler."
"Hi. I’m back."
"Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I’ve written it all down!"
"Ah that’s great. No actually that’s… (In a sexy voice)That’s great! That’s really great! Y’know, I gotta tell ya writing, I meanwriting, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot."
"Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! (Flips a couple pages and points tosomething.) Y’know what I wanted to be when I was that age?"
"A lover?"
"A surfer."
"Oh yeah surfer?"
"I wanted to be one with the waves, y’know?"
"Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, (sits on thecounter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here.Wait, now wait a second, this isn’t too revealing is it?"
"(barely glancing at her) No. What ever happened to that little dude.(Pause) So full of dreams…"
"I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listento anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is amental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Doyou know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you knowwhen I figured that out? While you were talking!"
"What?! I can’t believe you’re trying to stifle me! When just 14hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!"
"Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’tmean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming."
"Oh Rachel, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to overwhelm you.It’s just that, when those gates open, you… (Starts to breakdown.) Hard to close‘em. But they are closed now. Believe me."
"I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.)And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm… (Nods in thedirection of the bedroom.)"
"I would really like that. (They kiss.)"
"That was…so good. (Starts crying again.)"
"(entering from her room) Hey."
"I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumballmachine looking ring!"
"It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s abeautiful ring!"
"No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could seeMonica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes.When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and thenI can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thingI’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect."
"Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back.‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe wecan get him to trade rings or something."
"I can’t do that."
"Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring."
"There he is! (Points.)"
"Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on herfinger."
"Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes."
"Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him."
"Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with meplease? You have a phone call."
"Who is it?"
"It is your office."
"Do you know who at my office?"
"John?"
"Oh John! Great!"
"(To Chandler) Here he is."
"(to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store,the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I’mgonna need to have that back. (The guy isn’t sure.) But, in exchange I’m willingto trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew."
"Wow! I would trade."
"It is beautiful, but I’m gonna use this one. Now, if you’llexcuse me."
"No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring.You don’t want to break her heart now do you?"
"Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?"
"You’re dying?!"
"Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently."
"Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m notburied with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for alleternity…"
"(interrupting her) Okay, that’s enough honey!"
"I don’t know. (Pause) Let me see the ring."
"Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)"
"(looks at it) All right. (Exchanges rings.)"
"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And"
"Guys? (They ignore him.) I’ve got something important to tell ya.(Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over totry and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) I’m gonna ask Monica tomarry me."
"(To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out."
"Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?"
"Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)"
"Oh my God!!"
"So you two are really serious?!"
"Yep, pretty much."
"You-you’re gonna get married?! I mean… We’re gonna bebrothers-in-law! (They hug.)"
"And-and-and-and-and-and, and we’re gonna be friends again!"
"(goes to hug him and stops short) Heyyyy—What?"
"Oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it!"
"Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait ‘til uh, it was officialy’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my bestfriends."
"I think I’m gonna cry!"
"(who has just entered) Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped onecry baby, I’ll dump you too!"
"I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me."
"Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! (Hugs him.) You guys are gonna be sohappy!"
"I know."
"(holding an empty tissue box) Where’s all the tissues?! (Throws thebox down in disgust.)"
"Check out the ring."
"(gasps) Nice! One and a half carat easy."
"(entering) Hi."
"Hey-hey Pheebs!"
"What?"
"Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him!"
"Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring."
"You told her before you told us?"
"Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You canunderstand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the gameon TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)"
