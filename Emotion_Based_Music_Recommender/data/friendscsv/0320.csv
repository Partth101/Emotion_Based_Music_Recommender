"Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is theonly woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!"
"Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it’s like to be you?"
"Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?"
"Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kissher and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s likesomebody’s ripping out my heart!"
"Oh, it’s so"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away."
"Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
"We were all pretty shaken up about it."
"Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death wassomething that’s supposed to be sad, in a way."
"Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person."
"Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (toRoss) And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?"
"You get the dollhouse."
"I get the dollhouse!"
"Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel."
"Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?"
"No, just a barrel."
"Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse."
"Really?! Really?!"
"Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was toplay with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with."
"My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me."
"Hey, Sophie!"
"Hey, Rach!"
"Hey."
"Hey."
"Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me allthe way back up here."
"Oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem. (He starts to lookaround her office.)"
"Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’slingerie here in the office?"
"Yes, I realise that."
"Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)"
"That’s the stuff! (quickly grabs it)"
"Rachel, I need the"

"Bing! That’s a great name."
"Thanks, it’s ah, Gaelic, for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’So ah, I’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you."
"Me too."
"Bye, Chandler."
"(to Rachel) So ah, what’s wrong with him?"
"Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly noticeit anymore."
"Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?"
"No!! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone!"
"Oh, Rachel, (pause) actually, y'know what, forget it."
"Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too?"
"Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know somethingthat Sophie would do?"
"Uh, uh, uh, I am here."
"I know that."
"Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay.Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hello."
"Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful."
"I know!!!"
"So, I’m here, ready to play."
"Okay."
"I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (Sheremoves this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to thehouse.)"
"What’s this?"
"That’s a dog, every house should have a dog."
"Not one that can pee on the roof."
"Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactivewaste."
"(holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?"
"No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic."
"I don’t want a ghost."
"Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the houseis sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground."
"Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancientIndian burial ground? That would never happen."
"Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government."
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hello."
"I need to talk to you!"
"Sure, what’s up?"
"Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler."
"I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)"
"Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase."
"Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions aboutyou..."
"Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin’out the Chan-Chan man!"
"(looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are youinterested at all?"
"Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it."
"Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me."
"(holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into thehouse!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.)Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!"
"Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, allright? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size,they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go."
"Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we’re notwelcome in the house of no imagination."
"Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have tosay dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof!"
"The little ones do."
"Hey, Kate!"
"Morning."
"Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about lastweek..."
"Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! (she goes over to him)"
"(to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It wasgood, yeah..."
"Hi, oh, I’m Lauren, Kate’s understudy."
"Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani."
"I know! I-I’m a big fan of yours."
"(looks at her, shocked) What?!"
"I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on"
"Get out of here, really?!"
"Absolutely!"
"Yeah?"
"Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft."
"They gave me the shaft all right."
"(laughing) Oh, you’re so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doingafter rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?"
"Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, adrink sounds great."
"Cool! I-I’ll see you then."
"All right."
"All right, it’s time to act, my talking props. (Both Joey andKate just look at each other.)"
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!"
"Wow!!"
"Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealingthe interior.)"
"Hey, what’s this?!"
"Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slidesa doll down the slide)"
"It’s very interesting, Phoebe."
"What’s this?"
"The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests comeover, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed."
"This is the coolest house ever!!"
"Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights someincense)"
"All right!"
"I would!"
"Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!"
"Uh-huh."
"Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around thehouse.)"
"Ooohhhh!!"
"And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)"
"Ahhhh!!"
"(entering) Hey, my Father’s house does that!"
"(to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything."
"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothinglike a cool, crisp New York evening."
"Hmm."
"Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, becauseJoanna’s such a"
"Chandler is fantastic!!"
"What?!"
"Oh God, we just clicked! Y’know how people just click? Like he cameby to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?"
"Oh, I...."
"Oh, and he’s got such a good heart! Doesn’t he have a goodheart?"
"Oh, I know..."
"Oh, I know and he’s soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going tocall, so put him straight through."
"Isn’t this great?!"
"Don’t spoil it."
"Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?"
"(answering the phone) Hello. Oh! It’s you. Just ah, justone-one sec. (to Joey and Kate) I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope thatthere will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call,"
"(to Kate) That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?"
"He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweateryou’re dating."
"Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’sunderneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care whoI’m going out with?"
"I don’t care. Why, do you want me to care?"
"Do you want me to want you to care?"
"Do you?"
"What?"
"(returning) Okay, I’m afraid to say this, but let’s pickit up where we left off."
"Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?"
"I’ve got no reason to stay."
"Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is aterrible play! I’ll see you in the morning. (exits)"
"I can’t believe we go on in, in a week."
"Hey, it’s gonna be all right."
"(to Joey) Hey! So since we’re getting off early, do you want to goand paint mugs?"
"What?"
"You know! At the place I told you about last night?"
"Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah,y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight."
"Oh, okay."
"Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)"
"I’ll see you tomorrow. (she kisses him full on the mouth.)"
"Okay."
"G’night. (exits)"
"(to Kate) Ah, are you okay?"
"Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?"
"I don’t know."
"Well umm, maybe if it had more heat."
"How do you mean?"
"Well, Adrian’s looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can’tjust kiss her, he’s gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?"
"Maybe he could slip her the tongue."
"Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up."
"Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around hiswaist."
"And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and hisstomach!"
"And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and,and, and bite her!"
"And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with thisraw, animal...."
"Something like that?"
"Yeah, that’s pretty much what I had in mind."
"Yeah."
"(to Ross) Hey."
"Hi."
"(to Monica) Hey."
"Hi."
"Hey."
"It’s a little early to be drinkin’."
"No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate."
"Ohhhhh!"
"You’re kidding?! That’s great!"
"Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making..."
"Oh my."
"Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing inand breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keepgoing like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he’s beenprocessed by the devil, or something.)"
"(entering with Rachel) I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it allwrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime.I’ll give you a call.’"
"Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?"
"That’s what you say at the end of a date."
"You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’"
"To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standingthere, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion."
"Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’tmean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?"
"Well, they always called."
"Hmm, bite me."
"(entering) Did he call?"
"No. Sorry."
"Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?"
"Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women."
"Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t hecalled, Rachel? Why?"
"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because youare my boss."
"Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?"
"Well..."
"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’ttell him not to call me, did you?"
"No. I..."
"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone youwork for, there are always ways to fix...that."
"(grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!"
"Multiple, so many paper cuts."
"Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand.Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out,she’s gone crazy!"
"(sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then."
"Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that youhaven’t called her. You have to call her!"
"Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say,‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’"
"Well then you’re going to have to take her out again."
"Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goopthing in the corner of her eye!"
"I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take herout again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, Idon’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!"
"All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than anhour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybodyever again!"
"That’s fine!"
"That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know."
"I know."
"Mon?"
"(from the bathroom) I’m in the shower!"
"Oh, fire! There, there’s a fire! Fire!!"
"Hey."
"Hi."
"So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did youah, did you talk to Marshall?"
"About what?"
"Y'know, about what happened with us."
"Nooo. And there’s really no reason he should find out, so ahlet’s not make a big deal about it, okay?"
"What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on youcan’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there,you’re not that good an actress."
"Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That’s all itwas. Joey, I’m-I’m sorry you feel bad, but haven’t you ever sleep with awomen where it meant more to her than it did to you?"
"Nooo."
"(entering) Hi, Kate!"
"Hi, Lauren."
"Hi, Lauren."
"Hi, pig!"
"Sorry I ah, I scared you in there."
"Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the showermassager."
"Yeah."
"(entering) Hey!"
"(runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been afire."
"What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! Whathappened?!"
"Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to thepoint of origin.) In the Aroma Room."
"All right. Did everyone get out okay?"
"Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate."
"Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves toremove it.)"
"No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s underthere!!"
"(She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-theFoster puppets!"
"It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here,(points to his eye) and it’s all the time."
"Well, thanks again for lunch."
"(He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this waspleasant."
"It was, wasn’t it?"
"The food there was, was great."
"Wasn’t it?"
"So take care."
"You too."
"Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it againsometime. (Rachel is disappointed)"
"Great! I’m looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?"
"Sophie’s desk."
"(whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!"
"Noo!"
"Chandler!!"
"Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry."
"Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now.(She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)"
"Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you."
"What?"
"I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I wasgoing to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And thisisn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when itcomes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. AndI’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out."
"Well, this isn’t how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess Ihave to appreciate your honesty."
"Yeah, o-okay."
"So..."
"Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it againsometime!"
"(on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’veconsidered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I’ve ah, I’verecently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry. So, doyou think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down andcrosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs.Loreo, is Jennifer there? (listens) Oh, she’s not home huh? (listens) Well ah,actually I kinda need to talk to you too."
