"Hey!"
"Hi!"
"Is uh, is Monica here?"
"She’s steaming her dress, why? What’s up?"
"I think Chandler’s gone. (He hands her the note.)"
"What?!"
"He left that."

"(walking up) What’s up? (Rachel hands her the note and she readsit.) Tell Monica I’m sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!"
"Oh my God! Chandler just left though!"
"Yeah but, maybe it’s not what we think. Maybe it’s tell MonicaI’m sorry I…drank the last of the milk."
"Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he’s changed hisname, y’know? Tell Monica I’m sorry."
"I think it means he freaked out and left!"
"Don’t be so negative! Good God! Isn’t it possible that Sorryis sitting in there (Joey and Rachel’s apartment) right now?!"

"Oh man."
"Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifthavenue."
"Okay. Well there’s one down."
"(entering from her room, excitedly) I’m getting married today!!!(She trips and falls.) (Getting up) I think I just cracked a rib. But I don’t carebecause today’s my wedding day! My day is finally here!! (Runs back into her room.)"

"(looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do youneed some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)"
"Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandlerdoesn’t show up!"
"Oh here’s a whole bunch."
"Oh, I mean she’s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and peoplewill be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y’know? Then she’ll have tocome back here and live all alone."
"(finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!"
"What?"
"There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it’s positive.Monica’s pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she won’t be totallyalone."
"Oh my God!"
"I know! Monica’s gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as hersomething new?"
"Oh my God!"
"Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?"
"No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trashlast night."
"Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride ispregnant. The groom is missing. And I’m still holding this. (She throws the test backinto the trash.)"
"Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this."
"Right."
"Okay?"
"Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she wasusing?"
"No. Why?"
"Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it."
"Anything?"
"No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn’t heard from him. I-I-Italked to Chandler’s parents again!"
"You told them he was missing?"
"No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they boththink I’m interested in them."
"All right, we’ve got to tell her he’s gone. (Starts to leave.)"
"No! Hey! Hey! We can’t!"
"Ross, she’s gonna start getting ready soon!"
"Well, can’t you at least stall her a little? I’ll-I’ll goback to some of the places I went last night."
"All right, well how much time do you need?"
"Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?"
"One hour."
"Give me two."
"Then why do you ask?!"
"Okay, wish me luck."
"Okay. I’m going with you."
"Why?!"
"Ross, you’re tired. You’ve been looking all night. And clearlyyou suck at this."
"All right, I’ll see you guys later."
"Okay. Wait, do you know how you’re going to stall her?"
"I’ll figure something out."
"All right. Good luck."
"Thanks."
"Hey! Okay, so I thought we’d start with my make up and then do myhair."
"Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me."
"About what?"
"Umm… I’m never gonna getting married!"
"Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are wedone with that?"
"No Monica! I’m serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it.Become a lesbian or something."
"Any woman would be lucky to have ya."
"Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey."
"(jumping up) Rachel! You okay?"
"Excuse me, Aaron? (The director turns around.) Hi! Umm, I have a littleproblem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn’t supposed to work today, and I havethis wedding that I really have to be at. It’s my best friend’s, and I’mofficiating so I really can’t work past four."
"Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can’t stop filmingjust for you. It’s not like it’s your wedding. (Starts to walk away.)"
"I’m having surgery!"
"What?!"
"Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn’twant you to worry about me. But, I’m having surgery today."
"What kind of surgery?!"
"Transplant."
"But you’re supposed to work on Monday."
"Hair transplant."
"But you’re not bald."
"It’s not on my head."
"Look Joey, there’s nothing I can do. Besides, you’reprobably gonna be out by four anyway. We’ve just got one short scene. It’s justyou and Richard, and God knows he’s a pro. You’ll be fine. (Walks away and seesRichard entering.) Morning Richard."
"Hey! You’re here! Great! Great! Great! Let’s get going buddy,we’ve got a scene to shoot!"
"I’m wearing two belts."
"Are you drunk?"
"No!"
"Yes you are!"
"All right."
"We are never gonna find him! He’s one guy in a huge city!"
"Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.)"
"That is an old, Chinese woman!"
"He could be in disguise, y’know."
"Aw, y’know…Y’know, maybe we’re-we’re justapproaching this all wrong. If you’re Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is thelast place on Earth people would think you’d go?"
"So this is your office?"
"How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!"
"What the hell are you doing?!"
"Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’mrelated to Monica. How is she?"
"She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And shedoesn’t have to know, okay? Now come on, we’re going home."
"No! No! No! I can’t do that!"
"Why not?!"
"Because if I go home, we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’tbe the Bings!"
"What’s wrong with being the Bings?"
"The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they usethe pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!"
"Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up toyour hotel room?"
"No."
"Then you are neither of your parents!"
"It’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look ateverybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! AndI’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn!None of my proceeds go to charity."
"But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than Ido. But I totally believe you can do this."
"I want to. I love her so much, but I’m afr…It’s toohuge."
"Y’know, okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t wetake it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; justforget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?"
"Well yeah, but then…"
"(interrupting him) Yeah—No-but-but-but-but! We’re just gonna gohome and take a shower. Now, that’s not scary right?"
"Depends on what you mean by we."
"The nights are the hardest. (Checks her watch.) But then the day comes!And that’s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again…"
"(interrupting) The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm,Rachel I’m sorry! I have to start getting ready! I’m getting married today!"
"I know. At dusk. That’s such a hard time for me."
"(getting up) I’m gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at thehotel in an hour! (Starts for the bathroom.)"
"Okay. But wait!"
"What?!"
"Let’s go to lunch."
"I can’t go to lunch!!"
"Right."
"Oh good God! I’ve fallen down! (She trips and falls.)"
"(entering) What’s going on?"
"Okay. All right. (Gets up.) Honey listen. When I tell you what I’mabout to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we loveyou."
"Okay, you’re-you’re really freaking me out."
"We can’t find Chandler…(Phoebe sticks her head and motionsthat they found Chandler)—‘s vest. We can’t find Chandler’s vest."
"How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!"
"(entering) Found the vest! I mean we’re gonna have to keep an eyeon it, y’know make sure we don’t lose it again…"
"Oh!"
"Oh wow! Okay. Don’t scare me like that okay? I mean for a minutethere I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!""
"I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!"
"That can be arranged."
"Let’s reset."
"What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!"
"Let’s take it from there."
"(To Joey) Are you a little off today? It’s going terribly slowly."
"Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? AndI’m the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?"
"Of course! I’m-I’m sorry. I-I’d hate you to missanything like that on account of me. I can do this!"
"Thank you. Thank you."
"Still rolling, annnnd action!"
"I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!"
"Now, that can be arranged! (He brings his sword back and drops it,causing it to fly over the wall.) Slippery little bugger!"
"So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?"
"Here comes the bride."
"Oh my God Monica!"
"I wanna wear this everyday."
"You look so beautiful."
"(starting to cry) I’m so happy for me."
"Hello?"
"(on phone) Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?"
"Yeah, we got him back. Everything’s fine."
"Damnit!"
"What? Why? Where are you?"
"I’m still on the set!"
"Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!"
"I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me gountil we get this."
"Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister."
"No! No, I’m the minister! All right, look-look, put ‘em both onthe phone, I’ll marry them right now."
"Ugh! Joey, I have to go."
"Hey! Don’t you hang up on me! I’ll marry you and me right now! Ihave the power!"
"There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn’t so scary, was it?"
"No."
"I’m telling you, just a little bit at a time."
"Yeah okay. Well, what’s the next little bit?"
"Getting married. (Chandler panics.) Okay. Okay. You can, you can do thattoo! Just like you’ve done everything else!"
"Yeah. You’re right. Hey I-I can do that."
"Yeah."
"Okay, excuse me for a minute. (Starts to leave)"
"Wh—Hey—Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!"
"Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little freshair."
"Okay."
"Okay."
"Oh fresh air!"
"(To Rachel) Wait! Maybe, maybe you’re overreacting! You do thaty’know."
"Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! (They turn the corner.) Well,y’know. I mean there’s no way Joey’s gonna make it in time. So I’mgonna through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on."

"(pause) You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad."
"Well, he better not come by here. He can’t see the bride inthe wedding dress."
"As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the weddingdress."
