"Mornin’ Pheebs. (Sits down.) Well, my movie has officially beencanceled."
"Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?"
"Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?"
"What about my cab?"
"I don’t need that anymore."
"No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back."
"I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely.(Gets an idea.) Oh—ooh! How about you come with me?"
"I don’t know, it’s such a long trip."
"It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could beour chance to like renew our friendship."
"Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?"
"Sure?"
"All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stoppedloving you."
"Hi!"
"Hey."
"Hey."
"So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?"
"Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute."
"Where is the waitress?! I’m starving!"
"It’s a buffet man."
"Oh, here’s where I win all my money back! (Gets up and heads for thebuffet table with Chandler in tow.)"
"Listen, I gotta talk to you."
"Sure! What’s up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with ahuge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him aspoonful.)"
"Monica and I almost got married last night."
"Oh my God! That’s huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come Iwasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say,"Ross." Do"
"Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get marriedyet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming outof that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast.Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?"
"Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material."
"What?!"
"Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anythinglike me, she’s just gonna be relieved."
"How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna breakhis heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore."
"Well you don’t."
"Yes I do!"
"Good! Good! I was just testing you."
"(returning with Joey) Hi."
"Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon."
"No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable."
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"What?"
"Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…"
"(To Ross) I don’t know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night?Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night."
"Yeah!"
"Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch."
"Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!"
"(gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)"
"(not quite sure) You did."
"What?! Hello! We didn’t get married."
"No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!"
"We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel."
"Oh my God."
"I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!"
"No!"
"They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who getmarried in Vegas"
"Hell, I’m drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? Ican’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!"
"What are you guys gonna do?"
"Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)"
"Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’sfree, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free."
"Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to getdivorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment."
"An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here."
"Oh-oh, that’s your thing."
"What?"
"You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guywho gets divorced."
"Oh yeah!"
"No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love gettingdivorced!"
"Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so muchyou’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonnahave to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I’m so drunk."
"So, what do"
"I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!"
"I know I love you! (They hug.)"
"So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they haveall the marriages thing? I love you."
"That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dicedecide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!"
"Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, sosay uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there’s a"
"All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 wedon’t get married."
"Sounds great."
"Okay. (They approach the craps table.)"
"Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please."
"Ready?"
"Ready!"
"(sarcastic) Come on eight."
"(deadpan) Yes, yes eight."
"Eight! Easy eight. (She rolls a 3 and a 5 and they’re stunned.)"
"Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight."
"That was"
"Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hardeight."
"That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!"
"I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?"
"Yeah. (They go pack.) We’re doing the right thing, right?"
"Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up tofate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be aclear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandlerand Monica standing side-by-side holding each other’s hands.)"
"Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Comeon Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any (sees that he’s asleep)"
"(wakes up) What?!"
"Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road sixhours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next reststop and"
"All right. All right."
"Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because theradio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice."
"Really? I don’t…"

"(driving) Morning! (Phoebe screams again.)"
"Hey!"
"Hey, hubby!"
"Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that wholeannulment thing?"
"Uh-huh."
"I’m not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)"
"Okay! So, we’ll just stay married."
"Yes, exactly!"
"And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!"
"Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk youinto this more."
"Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually thinkyou’re kidding."
"I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have"
"What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!"
"Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill someform out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the boxthat says Mrs.! It’s"
"Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? Weabsolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far"
"I’m asking you to do me a favor."
"You are asking me to be your wife!"
"And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor."
"That kid really kicked me hard on the plane."
"Well you did pull his hair."
"He took my snack!"
"I’m not getting into this again!"
"Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad."
"Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay.(He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go ofMonica who is only holding on by his neck.)"
"This doesn’t mean anything, does it?"
"No!"
"Okay."
"(To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be arape—(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker’s face), a rapist or akiller or something!"
"Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!"
"Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (Tothe hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!"
"No!"
"Do you like car games?"
"Yeah, y’know the license plate game?"
"I"
"Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play!"
"No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes thepartition.)"
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may makeyou want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and"
"(thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look Ithought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not staymarried."
"I don’t know if it’s true."
"Oh b-b-but it is!"

"Then all your stuff would be here."
"Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
