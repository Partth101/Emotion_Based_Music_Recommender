"Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!"
"Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you alreadyknow! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she'sa woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica."

"Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make funof me because of my size! (She punches him again and almost knocks him off the arm of thecouch.)"
"Isn't this great?"
"Hmm."

"Well, you"
"Oh and"
"Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!"
"I do not have baby fever!"
"Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage andeverything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turndown the heat on this pressure cooker?!"
"Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is aboutyou and all your weird relationship commitment crap!"
"Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in thehead--in your head!"
"You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Racheltonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! Anddid you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)"
"Well, I did not know that."
"It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is,this is fixable."
"By me?"
"Oh, no!"

"Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture."
"Yeah, big!"
"Uh-oh, shht! The Misses."
"Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?"
"Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)"
"I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you."
"Just tell me what I need to do to make things right."
"What?!"
"Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me howto fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again."
"Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonnahave to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to bein a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)"
"Phoebe! (He grabs her arm to get her attention.)"
"Oh, hi Ross!"

"Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it’s a party forHoward. He's just the sweetest little man! (A guest walks up to her.)"
"See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!"
"You chipped in?!"
"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars."
"Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it wastotally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!"
"Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, theexotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be."
"Yeah, but you're making me look bad!"
"No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see youtalking to me and that's--I'm a hit!"
"(walking up) Oh hey, Pheebs!"
"Hey!"
"Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switchapartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about. (Walksaway.)"
"Yeah, okay, my bad."
"Hey!"
"Hi! Wow! You look, you look…big."
"Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearingsix sweaters?"
"Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why."
"Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extrapadding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she'sgonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?"
"(entering) Hi!"

"Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?"
"No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, allright? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?"
"So uh, what did you tell them about me?"
"Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get somesympathy."
"Ohh. (He cuts himself a piece of cake.)"
"But somehow you came off as the bad guy."
"What?!"
"Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that becauseI don't totally understand what happened there."
"(trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!"
"Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!"
"(sees the cake) Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake! (Ross triesdumping it into a nearby plant.) Who would do a think like that?"
"3-B!"
"Oh yeah, aww!"
"Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you thinkit's time you went home?!"
"Yeah, leave!"
"Yeah, get out! Now!"
"Go back to 3-B, 3-B!"
"All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something thatI would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand andPhoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-hedidn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likesRoss," and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with youguys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him Isaw that he's really sweet and caring and"
"Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I justthought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then youcould look like the hero."
"Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that."
"Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Isshe here?"
"(raising her hand) I'm Monica."
"I need to talk to you, it's urgent!"
"Okay."
"Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh,us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly andawkwardly gets down on one knee.)"
"Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!"
"(getting out a ring box) Monica…"
"No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!"
"Will you marry me?"
"Oh-no. No. No."
"What a bad idea!"
"Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)"
"Chandler, why are you doing this?"
"I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this."
"Chandler."
"I'm doing this because I'm sorry?"
"Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is becauseyou're sorry?"
"No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty muchfourth y'know, behind being ready and actually"
"(kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and Iwant you to think about how"
"Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now."
"Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I neversaid I wanted to have babies and get married right now!"
"Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to theseguys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)"
"Who? Two divorces and Joey?!"
"Hey!"
"She's right y'know."
"Yeah, but still, cheap shot!"
"Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with thisrelationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that."
"I didn't think I was!"
"Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?"
"Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend therest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped holein that door. (Points at the door.)"
"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?"
"No, I will not!"
"Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it."
"You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?"
"Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello toyou last week."
"Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them tomove in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?"
"Okay, how long is this going to go on."
"Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane youwere so, a long time."
"This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a breakthing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one islaughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)"
"That's not funny."
"That's not funny at all!"
