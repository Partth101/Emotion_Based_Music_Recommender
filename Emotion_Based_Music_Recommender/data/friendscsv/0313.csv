"Hmmm, that’s very cool."
"Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no,no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second theyget away. Aww!"

"Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys thehotel, and kills the dad."
"Eh. Beth dies."
"Beth, Beth dies?"
"Um-hmm."
"Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?"
"No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?"
"What?!"
"Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’sever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?"
"No. She doesn’t die."
"Then why would you say that?!"

"What are you smiling at?"
"I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up."
"Yeah, right."
"Hello."
"I love this friend thing!"
"Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you justtell him?"
"Oh."
"Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is iton the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’"
"We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely knowand talk about his.... stuff."
"He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary. (Hestops and thinks about what he just said.)"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey."
"(to Phoebe) So are ready for the gym? They’ve got this new rockclimbing wall, we can spot each other."
"No, I can spot you from here."
"What?"
"Okay, listen Robert..."
"(to Chandler) Hey, don’t we have to..."
"Yeah, we got, um-hmm."
"Umm, I think you’re really, really great..."
"Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? (spreadshis legs) Is it something I’m putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?"
"I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say."
"(cleaning up the table) (to Robert) Hey buddy, this is a family place,put the mouse back in the house."
"Ow!"
"(outside the bedroom) Really?! Well, it’s just like everyoneelse’s apartment. It’s got rooms, walls, and ceilings."
"Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give methe tour."
"Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom asRichard starts the tour.)"
"Ah well, this is the living room."
"Impressive."
"All right. This is the kitchen."
"Oh, that’s real pretty. Wait a minute, don’t Iget to see the bedroom?"
"The bedroom. Well it’s pretty much your typical... (opens the dooras Monica hides under the covers, and quickly closes the door before his date can see theroom.) bedroom."
"We’re still on this side of the door."
"Um-hmm."
"Yeah, but I didn’t get to see it."
"Oh shoot! Maybe next time. (yawns) Thanks for a lovely evening. (showsher out)"
"(still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?"
"Oh, (laughs) that was the blind date that I told you about, she calledand switched it to today."
"(still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I’m justasking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this."
"Well, you seem fine."
"(gets up) Okay, y'know what, I’m not fine, I’m not. I mean howcan I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause)Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?"
"You mean like exclusive friends?"
"Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be soterrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stoodup in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever."
"Wow. Y'know we’re back where we were. Honey, I would love to doall that, but nothing’s changed."
"That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache."
"Okay, okay, one thing’s changed. But we still want differentthings and we know how this is gonna end."
"Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘causegetting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think Icould do it again."
"I know I couldn’t. So...."
"How ‘bout one last game of racquetball?"
"Watch the thorns!"
"(lying down) Ow!!"
"What?"
"Beth is really, really sick."
"Awwww."
"Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she coulddo."
"Joey?"
"Yeah."
"Do you want to put the book in the freezer?"
"(nodding his head) Okay."
"Okay."
