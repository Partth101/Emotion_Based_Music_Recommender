"Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lotmore than just season seats."
"It’s the Knicks!"
"Screw the Knicks!"
"Whoa!"
"I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth somuch more."
"Huh."
"And the Knicks rule all."

"Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!"
"It was."
"Those were like the best seats ever."
"Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kindalike a peace offering."

"Totally worth it!"
"That was one good minute!"
"Good night."
"Good night."
"Men are such idiots."
"Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us ourapartment back?"
"That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right afterthe last contest, no one would have had to move at all."
"Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true."
"Yeah."
