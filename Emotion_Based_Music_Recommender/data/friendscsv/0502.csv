"Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY."
"Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!"
"What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, Icouldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming upto me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it wassooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why,because I make very bad decisions."
"Oh that's not true."
"Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London."
"London is stupid! Stupid!"
"Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from nowon you make all of my decisions for me."
"Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable havingthat kind of power and control over someone's life."
"I'll do it!"
"That's fine. So Monica,"
"Okay, I gotta go to work."
"And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back."
"Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Alwaysa pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)"
"Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and youat the reception."
"Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't—I still can't believeit. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)"
"Honey, sweetie, by the edges."

"…I mean it's my fault."
"Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!"
"Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)"
"Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, Iknow that wasn't about me."
"(To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little."
"If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would noticethat there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns tolisten in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute."
"Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…"
"(Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points atanother guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember?"
"Oh, I don't know. I don't know."
"You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make yourdecisions and I say you're going to talk to him."
"All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me."
"Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)"

"No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I everget to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out."
"Sorry."
"What happened?"
"Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a datetomorrow night."
"See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!"
"Well…"
"(To the guy) Get out!"
"What took you so long?"
"I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow."
"Oh, good."
"So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kissesher.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs herand kisses her.)"
"(Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!"
"Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London."
"That's not European!"
"Well, it felt French."
"Oh God, I really had a good time!"
"Yeah, me too. (They reach her door.) So, I guess this is it."
"Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?"
"Yeah!"
"Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this.Umm, okay, just hold on a second."
"Okay, yeah!"
"Umm, hi!"
"Hi."
"Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something."
"She's doing her laundry."
"What's that? (Points to the box.)"
"It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one foreach day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!"
"Oh, honey that's awful."
"Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna gowander out in the rain for a while."
"But, it's not raining."
"I can't catch a break!"
"Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit righthere. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. Allright? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!"
"Yeah?"
"Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is justreally sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I knowthings seem so bad right now."
"(Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I droppedsome socks."
"Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for thedropped socks.)"
"What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do youwant to fall"
"Ohh!"
"I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, youlisten to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! Whatthe hell were you trying to do?"
"Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know,that I'm still in love with him."
"(Gasps) What?!! You"
"Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!"
"I make the decisions, and I say no."
"Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what,you're fired."
"You can't fire me."
"Well… (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry andthrows it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close thedoor. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)"
"Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!"
"(Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?"
"Rachel locked the door."
"I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar."
"Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!"
"Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?"
"No."
"I really need to talk to you."
"Well, then talk!"
"Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wantedto do?"
"Yes!"
"What thing?"
"Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is areally stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knowswho she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting."
"Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. Igotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) MyGod, think of the massacre."
"I'm gonna do it."
"All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before youtell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea.Because I bet you, you can't."
"But I…"
"Please!"
"All right, fine."
"Joey, I'm in!"
"(In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal."
"Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!"
"Uh, okay, Pheebs?"
"Yeah?"
"Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get togo to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?"
"Yeah?"
"All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should alltake a little trip together!"
"Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!"
"Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in CentralPark!"
"(excited)"
"Yeah, all of us! All day!"
"That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are wegonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, allright!""
"Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Parkidea. (Gets up to leave.)"
"(stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr.Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new Europeanthing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortableand I just—y'know—stop it!"
"I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group."
"That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth."
"Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.)"
"Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!"
"Phoebe!"
"Hey, Pheebs!"
"Phoebe, woo!"
"Okay, woo! Hi."
"Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know, itdidn't have any… It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that wewould all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!"

"Come on Rach, let's go."
"Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute."
"No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him."
"Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter."
"Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someonethat you love them and not have them say it back?"
"Yeah, I-I don't care."
"Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)"
"What 'cha readin'?"
"The paper."
"Yeah, what's it about?"
"Events from around the globe."
"Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have totalk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they'rewrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong."
"Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…"
"Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here."
"Yeah."
"Okay."
"Go ahead."
"Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna sayit. Uhh, (pause) I'm still in love with you Ross."
"Wow. Umm… Huh… I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now."
"What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean."
"(Laughing) I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious."
"Why are you laughing?"
"Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it'sridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, andit's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know?And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like,"You are such an idiot!""
"Well, well I"
"(laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny."
"Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know wheremy wife is. (Laughs) "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!"
"Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that youjust forget that I told you this?"
"Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…"
"The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily."
"That is what the thing is."
"Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was thatjust the stupidest thing, me telling you that?"
"No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's alwaysgreat when someone tells you they love you."
"That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.)"
"No thank you for… Thank you."
"Okay, let's go!"
"Atlantic City!"
"Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five forrolling bones!"
"Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?"
"Oh my God! You're water broke!"

"Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (They all high-five again.)"
"I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!"
"I know, it's beautiful. Amazing."
"Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachelevery time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex."

"That's all right."
"Okay. (They kiss again.)"
