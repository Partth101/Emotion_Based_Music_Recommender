"I tell people secrets. It makes them like me."
"(entering) Oh."
"Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)"
"Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get inbed, and stay there."

"Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off."
"Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneezein the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People.(Starts to sing)"
"(sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!"
"Hi."
"Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight overthe remote."

"So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozyvoice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me."
"Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets whenyou were 14?"
"Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that"Woo-hoo" thing."
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hey."
"(loudly) So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!"
"Rachel's not here."
"Oh."
"How's it going with her?"
"Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah,the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and Ibreak open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves."

"Hi, Josh."
"Hi."
"Dudes."
"So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football forthe rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)"
"Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though."
"Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that'sright. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64."
"Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna...head."

"Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for theadult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?"
"Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)"
"What was that?"
"Monica knows."
"It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool ourparents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember Icried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I wasactually cooler than my older brother."
"Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my datetonight, so ah, I'll just_ head."
"Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, (clears hervoice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries tosing)"

"Ughh! (Storms out after him)"
"(to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. Andthere's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water."
"Thank you so much Phoebe."
"(picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure."
"What are you doing with those?!"
"But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice."
"Sorry, Phoebe."
"It's okay. How's the soup?"
"Umm. (nodding her head, "Good.")"
"Ohhhh!! Gross!!"
"Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!"
"Is she great or what?"
"(to Chandler) So? Huh? What do you think?"
"Ohh, she's-she's not really my type."
"Not your type?! She's gorgeous!"
"Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know?Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnetstockings."
"Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I havea friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!"
"Uhh, no-no thanks."
"Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too."
"Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)"
"(to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?"
"What?"
"Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had adeal."
"Hey, look, what do you want from me?"
"I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, thenthe least you can do is pretend."
"I am pretending."
"Well then, do it better!"
"Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?(Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinkingabout her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'mso fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for everyminute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met herfirst!!"
"Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little."
"(entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's oneof the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh,I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?"
"No, sorry."
"Well where's Amanda?"
"Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?"
"I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could goup to your old room, and not make out."
"Ross, cough drops, please?"
"At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies."
"Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorryI forgot, she's not a lesbian."
"You see Amanda and I have a very special..."
"(interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're herbaby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!"
"(laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad."
"And what are you laughing at, Miss`My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'"
"Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me somethingwith it! (Shows her, her ring)"

"Can I sleep on your couch?"
"(singing)"
"Rachel?"
"Yeah."
"I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe theother day_"
"No!"
"Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn'tstop it, and I've been feeling guilty."
"(confused) Okay."
