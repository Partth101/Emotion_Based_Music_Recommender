"Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?"
"Oh, which museum?"
"(just Phoebe) No, answer his."
"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near thedoor, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at mymercy."
"Were you so late because you were burring this woman?"
"No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. Sheseems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hoursaway."
"How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at theyall look at him) That joke would’ve killed in Albany."
"Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now? (He smiles and has cookieremains all over his teeth.)"
"Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They’re lighting the bigChristmas tree tonight."
"Umm, that paper’s two weeks old."
"All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I reallywanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it."
"Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I"
"Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling."
"Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung."
"Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas."
"Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do youwant me to set you up?"
"Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve beensingle. How come you never offered this before?"
"Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longerfeel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy."

"Oh."
"I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, Iget off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef’shat. (The hat says ‘Quit, bitch’)"
"Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’"
"Hey, honey! What’s the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, Iwas just trying to be nice! Whoa!"
"I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and theyhad to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs andMonica glares at him.)"
"Ohhh!"
"I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit,and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting formy whole life."
"Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yellat them? Or, fire them?"
"I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you knowthat I’m not good at confrontation."
"Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director,I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just sohe could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss."
"Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?"
"That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?"
"Good enough to get fired."
"All right, you’re hired!"
"Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guydirect"
"(he glares at him for a while) Yes."

"I didn’t think you were gay. I do now."
"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up."
"Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I’m not looking for anything serious."
"Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of afling, that might be all right with Rachel."
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmasparty, Rachel?"
"(to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name."
"Oh wow! I’m free for her!"
"Oh, wait a second! I didn’t say I wasn’t free!"
"Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger gametomorrow?"
"Hold on, y’know I"

"Oh yeah! With who?"
"You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?"
"Yeah."
"Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decidebetween the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s atwo hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But thisother girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, wellshe’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s"
"If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?"
"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives soclose. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something thatwas—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding,she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist."
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Hey, man!"
"Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?"
"(checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)"
"(entering from the dining room) Hey."

"Well, like father, like son."
"Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think thiscould maybe turn into something serious."
"Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? Ithought you were looking for some kind of a fling."
"Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didn’t tell him that, though?Right?"
"Ummmmmmmm, no."
"You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tellthe guy that!"
"Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was justlooking to get—oh I see."
"Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me puttingout on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea."
"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?"
"Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. SinceI don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool worknickname."
"(entering) Hey, dragon! Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday.(hands him two envelopes)"
"(opening an envelope) There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks inthis one!"
"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it neverhurts to wear tight trousers."

"Because we can remember them."
"Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them likeyou did the other night?"

"No ma’am."
"Hey! He has a name, it’s Dragon. Do you wanna know your name?Check your hat. (to another waiter) We did the hat right? (The other waiter nods yes.)"
"What the hell happened?!"
"I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing therewith 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking,"Wow! It’s been a long time since I had… (tries to do the math in his head,but can’t) 327 + 238 dollars!""
"Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’vegot to fire you!"
"And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me,instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nicethings I’ve been saying about you."
"What kinda things have you been saying?"
"Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in."

"The one with the cat. I gotta go, I’ve got another date."
"So, did you pick one yet?"
"No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was adifferent joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn."
"Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown andyou’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just endthem both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on yourway back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’redone!"
"Y’know, you’re right. Thank you."
"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague."
"Prague?"
"There’s sooo much you don’t know."
"Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you nottell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?"
"I did! I absolutely did!"
"You idiot!!"
"I’m sure you’re right, but why?"
"You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a seriousrelationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!"
"Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry."
"Y’know, you should"
"I know! I know!"
"Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Beingalone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)"
"Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody!You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, Ididn’t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)"
"Really?"
