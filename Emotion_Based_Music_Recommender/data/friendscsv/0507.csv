"Okay, let's go."
"Okay!"

"Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great!Y'know so you can cook while in the tub."

"I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking."
"But hey, Ross, this place is available now!"
"Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks."
"Yeah."
"(To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?"
"Oh, it's perfect!"

"Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!"
"Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry thehealth inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like,okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?"
"Well, I suppose I could give him a warning."
"Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go!(He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, Iknow a hot dog vendor who picks his nose."
"Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!"
"Yes that was a nice place!"
"Yeah!"
"Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out thewindow in a bag!"
"Yeah!"
