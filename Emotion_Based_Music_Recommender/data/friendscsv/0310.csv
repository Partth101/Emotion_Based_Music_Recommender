dialogue
"(reading the comics) Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know."
"What?"
"Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should stillbe allowed to fly this thing?"
"Rachel?"
"Yeah."
"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeksgetting trained by another waitress?"
"Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?"
"(laughs) Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the trainingagain, whenever."
"(to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?"
"(thinks about it) Yeah?"
"So that’s two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the BrownBirds of America, I salute you. (Does the Brown Bird salute, she blows on a bird call,then holds her hand, palm facing out, next to her face, and then waves it like a birdflapping it’s wings.)"
"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand."
"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand."
"Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand."
"I was shrieking... like a Marine."
"All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championshipplay. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does abackswing and hits Sarah who’s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they bothwatch in horror.)"
"You broke a little girl’s leg?!!"
"I know. I feel horrible. Okay."
"(reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on"
"Well, I’m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what doyou think she’ll like?"
"Maybe a"
"I’m gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)"
"All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)"
"Look out kids, he’s coming! (Ross continues to leave with hishead down in shame.)"
"And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees."
"Have fun. Oh wait, no, don’t! I forgot I am totally against thatnow."
"What? Me having a job?"
"No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, andtheir, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey,how do you sleep at night?"
"Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey,Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, theirfulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy."
"Really?"
"Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most ofthem, it’s the only chance to see New York."
"...and after you’ve delivered the drinks, you take the emptytray...."
"Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a halfyears, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)"
"What if you put them here. (sets the empty tray on another stack ofempty trays on the back counter.)"
"Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because thatway they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitressesdo that too."
"They already do. That’s why they call it the ‘trayspot.’"
"Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that itwas a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry. (walks away)"
"It’s all right. Sweetheart."
"So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me thatyou get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell thosecookies anymore."
"Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the mostwins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a"
"Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?"
"Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments,as I do daydreaming about outer space, he’d be able to afford a trip to the TajMahal."
"I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all theway to India."
"No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he’sgonna double the college money my Grandma left me."
"Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have tosell in order to win?"
"The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five."
"Yeah."
"So far, I’ve sold seventy-five."
"Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out hiswallet) How much are the boxes?"
"Five dollars a box."
"(puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?"
"A ten speed bike. But, I’d rather have something my Dadcouldn’t sell."
"Well, that makes sense."
"Could you do me one favor, if it’s not too much trouble?"
"Yeah, Sarah, anything."
"Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the spaceshuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don’t have a TV, the lady across thealley said she’d push hers up to a window, so I could watch it."
"(looking through her peephole, we see Ross standing in the hallway.)Yesss?"
"Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies."
"You’re no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole."
"No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Birdsalute.)"
"What does that mean?"
"Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited tosleep-overs."
"I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!"
"No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to goto Spacecamp more than anything in the world."
"I’m pressing, a policeman is on his way."
"Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going. (goes across the hall to knockon another door.)"
"I can still see you!"
"All right!!"
"(walking up to Joey) Hey."
"Hey. What, what are you doing here?"
"Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh,all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh..."
"Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas...."
"Destiny."
"Sure."
"Yes."
"All right."
"Okay. (One of Joey’s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes!That one doesn’t look very fulfilled."
"Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s justtaking it to the back."
"You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist."
"Well we have to make room for the fresh ones."
"So, what happens to the old guys?"
"Well, they go into the chipper."
"Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds? (Joeypoints out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to playin the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face againstJoey’s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)"
"(to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the ‘cutit’ motion with his hands)"
"...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters,Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus."
"All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s."
"Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl toSpacecamp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?"
"Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?"
"No, but ah, there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell youwhat, I’ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night."
"Mon?"
"All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, andthat’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross)Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?"
"Ah, no Mon, Dad"
"No."
"Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em."
"Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this."
"I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free."
"(she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)"
"Come on! All the cool kids are eating ‘em! (chases after her.)"
"And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’tjust trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there."
"(sitting down next to Chandler) I’m training to be better at a jobthat I hate, my life officially sucks."
"Look Rach, wasn’t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought youwanted to do fashion stuff?"
"Well, yeah! I’m still pursuing that."
"How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending outresumes like what, two years ago?"
"Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts."
"If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothingpushing you to get another one. You need the fear."
"The fear?"
"He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to goafter a job you really want."
"Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean whydon’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?"
"Because, I’m too afraid."
"I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer,y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here."
"Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and"
"Rachel?"
"Yeah."
"Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular."
"Can’t I just look at the handles on them?"
"You would think."
"Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you knowwhy I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. Idon’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where thetray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t thinkI should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice."
"What?!"
"Gunther, I quit."
"(to Joey) Does this mean we’re gonna have to start paying forcoffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)"
"....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?"
"I spelled out boobies."
"(comes up and starts looking through Ross’s cookie supply) Ross,but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the minttreasures?"
"Ah, we’re out. I sold them all."
"What?"
"Monica, I’m cutting you off."
"No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it’s no bigdeal, all right, I’m-I’m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!"
"Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck."
"(covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)"
"So, how many have you sold so far?"
"Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!"
"Oh my God, how did you do that?"
"Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘LaserFloyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So Iah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. Theycall me: 'Cookie Dude!'"
"(entering) Okay, stop what you’re doing, I need envelope stuffers,I need stamp lickers....."
"Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?"
"Me! On my computer."
"Well you sure used a large font."
"Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squadco-captain only took up so much room."
"Hey-hey-hey that’s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy!You wanna know what else is really funny?!"
"Something else I might have said?"
"I don’t know, I don’t know, weren’t you the guy that toldme to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!"
"Sweetie, calm down, it’s gonna be okay."
"No, it’s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and Idon’t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna callGunther and I’m gonna tell him, I’m not quitting."
"You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear."
"You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you andyour fear...."
"(entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!"
"Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)"
"What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?"
"No."
"Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they havean opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?"
"Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey."
"Not a problem."
"Thanks."
"And now for the great news."
"What, that wasn’t the great news?"
"Only if you think it’s better than this... (holds up an aerosol can)snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kindof Christmas lookie."
"Christmas cookie?"
"Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it’s a little moremoney, but you get a nicer smell."
"Looks good. I’ll take it."
"(running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, youdon’t want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost deadtree she has)"
"It’s-it’s-it’s almost dead!"
"Okay but that’s why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it’sChristmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey"
"Yeah, the ah, trees that don’t fulfil their Christmas destiny arethrown in the chipper."
"I-I think I’m gonna look around a little bit more."
"Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here."
"(entering) Hey, guys. I’m here to pick out my Christmas tree."
"Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one’s yours!Ahhh."
"Is this the one that I threw out last year?"
"All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one!I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get so emotional, I guess it’sjust the holidays, it’s hard."
"Oh honey, is that ‘cause your Mom died around Christmas?"
"Oh, I wasn’t even thinking about that."
"Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a ‘way-to-go’ thumbsup and smile.)"
"(to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did yousell?"
"I’m not gonna tell you! You’re the bad man who brokeSarah’s leg."
"Hey now! That was an accident, okay."
"You’re a big scrud."
"What’s a scrud?"
"Why don’t you look in the mirror, scrud."
"I don’t have too. I can just look at you."
"All right girls, and man. Let’s see your final tallies. (all thegirls raise their hands) Ohhhh, Debbie, (looks at her form) 321 boxes of cookies, (toDebbie) Very nice."
"(to himself) Not nice enough."
"Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good."
"(to himself) Good for a scrud."
"Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871."
"That’s crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does thesalute)"
"Who’s next? (goes over and stands behind Ross, who’sfeverishly writing on his form, and clears her throat to get his attention.)"
"Hi there!"
"Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like youbought an awful lot of cookies yourself."
"Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious....nuget.... diffency."
"Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross."
"Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year oldsister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes."
"(to Rachel, who’s entering) Hey! How’d the interview go?"
"Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me."
"Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you’re gonna go on like a thousandinterviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) That’s not how that was supposedto come out."
"This is the worst Christmas ever."
"Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at thecoffee house."
"I can’t! It’s too late! Terry already hired that girl overthere. (points to her) Look at her, she’s even got waitress experience. Last nightshe was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans."
"That word was swans."
"Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up myChristmas."
"Oh! Oh my God!"
"(jumping up from behind the couch) Merry Christmas!!"
"You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you’re the best!"
"It’s like ‘Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.’"
"(answering the phone) Hello? (listens) Yeah, this is she. (listens) Oh!You’re kidding! You’re kidding! (listens) Oh thank you! I love you!"
"Sure, everybody loves a kidder."
"(hanging up the phone) I got the job!"
"That’s great! Hey! Excellent!"
"Oh, God bless us, everyone."
"Here we go. I’m serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang startshumming the graduation theme) There you go. (hands it to Chandler) Enjoy. (they all cheer)"
"(to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?"
"No."
"Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and Iah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it’sjust time to move on. (at the counter Gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room)Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good itfeels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again."
"Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonnause two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, ‘cause this part’s tricky,see some people use filters just once."
"I’m, I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Spacecamp, andI’m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting SarahTuttle’s Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jumpup, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered intinfoil.)"
"Really Mr. Geller, you don’t have to do this."
"Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand byfor mission countdown!"
"(simulating an echo)"
"I’m an alien. I’m an alien."
"Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joey’shead.)"
