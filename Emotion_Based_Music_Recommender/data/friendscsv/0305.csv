"Nooo! Why would you think that?"
"I don’t know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, Imean, I don’t know."
"Whatever, it’s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways."
"Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can’t believe thatI screwed it up so bad."
"You really thought it was perfect?"
"Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn’t perfect, but y'know it was prettycool, y'know, ‘cause we had all those great talks y'know."
"Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?"
"Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about mylikes and my dislikes..."
"I don’t...."
"How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn’tmelt."
"Right, okay, um-mm."
"Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you ‘cause y'knowyou’re my sister, y'know."
"Yeah, I guess I do, yeah."
"Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me."
"Well, I-I wasn’t hopping mad, y'know."
"You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry."
"Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now,this."
"This?"
"Uh-huh."
"Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, Ialmost got arm broken by a hooker..."
"She wasn’t a hooker."
"Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be."
"Okay, on three. One....Two...."
"Why don’t we just go on two."
"Why two?"
"Because it’s faster."
"Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this‘two’ talk."
"Oh!"
"All right, but in the future..."
"Okay!! Okay!!"
"Come on!"
"Heavy thing, not getting lighter!"
"Okay, one...two..."
"So we are going on two?"
"All right!! (they lift it into place, however there is one small problem,the unit is so long that it blocks some of both of their bedroom doors.)"
"Oh, good job Joe."
"Wow, it’s big!"
"Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!"
"Maybe, my ruler’s wrong."
"Maybe all the rulers are wrong."
"Look it’s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, alittle of my door."
"Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocksnone of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and moveit, but it doesn’t move.)"
"Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet."
"Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf,double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guynods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak."
"(to Gunther) Thank you."
"(to Gunther) Um, coffee to go, please."
"Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)"
"Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God."
"Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list."
"Why? ‘Cause otherwise you’d go for it?"
"Yeah, maybe."
"Oh-oh, you lie."
"What you don’t think I’d go up to her?"
"Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me."
"Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated."
"You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate."
"Okay, hold my crawler."
"Okay."
"Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?"
"Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m justsorry we don’t got popcorn."
"(to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I’m Ross, you don’t know me, but I’ma big, big fan of yours. I mean,"
"Aren’t you with that girl over there? (points at Rachel, whowaves back)"
"Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding,um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I’m allowedto sleep with you. No, no, no, it’s flattery."
"I’m sorry. (starts to leave)"
"Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don’t, don’t just dismissthis so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity..."
"Yeah, for you. Is that the list?"
"Um, yeah."
"May I see it?"
"Um, no."
"Come on! (grabs the list)"
"But, okay."
"(reading it) I’m not on the list!"
"Um, see, but that’s not the final draft."
"It’s laminated!"
"Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler(Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumpedyou for Wynona Rider, local."
"Y'know it’s ironic..."
"What?"
"...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterdayI bumped you for that guy over there. (points at a guy and leaves)"
"(to the rest of the gang) We’re just gonna be friends."
"Y'know what?"
"Umm?"
"I bet ‘ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)"
"I’ve got five bucks says you can’t."
"Get out your checkbook, mister."
"Oh, I think I have the cash."
"You are dogged man! I totally fit!"
"Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles sothat the doors won’t open) I’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crackbetween the door and frame) Here you go."
"Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr.Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinksare on me!"
