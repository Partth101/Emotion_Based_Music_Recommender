"Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous."
"Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?"

"It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay?Because I’m a teacher and"
"Oh, is that against the rules?"
"No, but it is frowned upon."
"I see."
"Besides, there’s a big age difference."
"Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90…"
"I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem likesuch a big difference."
"No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going tosay is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to bewith a 20-year-old."
"Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-whobecame a movie director?"
"Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class."

"What are you smiling about? What is so funny?"
"The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!"

"(to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform thisThursday?"
"Excuse me?"
"Joey! He’s working! (To Chandler) You would look"

"Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there thatisn’t burned is an ass. Which I do"
"How’s your room Rach?"
"Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite bluesweater. (Hold it up.)"
"Isn’t that mine?"

"No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?"
"Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me!It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!"

"Hey-hey listen… (Chandler waves him away.)"
"Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm… (Joey mimesthrowing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven andcutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!"

"(on phone) Hi! I’m back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, thatsounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, we’ll do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (Hehangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)"
"Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I knowit’s Thursday, but what time?"
"Hi."
"Hey!"
"(To Joey) We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take herto coffee and then we’ll do it then."
"Ah-ha!"
"Wow! So, now you’re going on a date with this girl?"
"Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years!You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask themfor a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time."
"You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’rey’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend."
"No, we only went out once."
"You dated her!"
"Not once!"
"All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joeya favor?!"
"Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turnsaround to see Chandler glaring at him.)"
"(laughs) Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the moviebusiness."
"Y’know who I ran into from school? Howie."
"(giggles) My friend’s name is Joey."
"Apparently Howie’s editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asksme if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y’know I-I-I haven’tspoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!"
"Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie."
"No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffeefirst!"
"The nerve huh?"
"Yeah!"
"Refill?"
"Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?"
"Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here."
"I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’sonly room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s."
"Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you shouldget to stay here."
"Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was anaccident."
"Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room."
"Okay! (She jumps on the bed.)"
"So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’lljust have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bringthem to you, y’know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much."
"I have."
"This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) Anduh that’s where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)"
"What’s that smell?"
"I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.)"
"Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!"
"What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson."
"Who?"
"Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda cameup with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt."
"Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?"
"Umm, no. No."
"Yes you did! What was it?"
"Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty."
"Ohh that’s so sweet!"
"Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time! Y’know howbefore you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank Ithought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all."
"(exiting from a restaurant) Dr. Geller!"
"(pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!"
"So did you sleep well last night?"
"I did."
"Yeah?"
"I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow."
"Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?"
"What?"
"Gum!"
"Well, we determined the cause of the fire."
"Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!"
"No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It’s lookslike a curling iron."
"I don’t use a curling iron."
"Well someone does."
"Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight!Straight! Straight!"
"It could’ve been a hair straightener."
"Oh."
"This is where I keep the pizza. (It’s the same location as before.)And—Hey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in it’s spot.)"
"Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!"
"Thanks Monica!"
"Does that smell bother you?"
"What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here."
"Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie tocover it."
"I can smell it a little, bake the pie."
"Okay!"
"Okay."
"Hello? (Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe) It’s foryou. It’s the fire inspector."
"Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens)Really?!"
"(in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hairstraightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, itwas the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of thefirst things they teach you in fire school is… (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh…Uhh… Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)"
"We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thoughtthe-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all.Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.)(To Monica) A concept lost on some people!"
"So it’s okay to date a student."
"Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against therules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into lastnight, Judgey von Holierthanthou."
"Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputationas y’know Professor McNailshisstudents."
"Yeah. What-what should I do?"
"Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? Whatpeople think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart."
"Joey that is so sweet."
"(entering) Hey."
"Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave ablock of time open say Thursday?"
"I couldn’t do it."
"You couldn’t do it?!"
"Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight."
"What?! You’re going out with her again!"
"Going out with who?"
"Uh, Dana Keystone from college."
"Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh… (Does the international sign for bigboobies.)"
"No, that was Dana Caplin."
"Joey! You didn’t even know her!"
"Ah whatever!"
"Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!"
"Y’know uh, actually I-I-I should get going."
"Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you shouldstay!"
"Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don’t feel that wayabout you."
"Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!"
"I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, Idon’t want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feelbetter."
"No-no—Really?!"
"Of course!"
"(breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh…"
"Ohh, I’m sorry."
"Well maybe there is one thing you can do."
"What?! Anything! Anything!"
"Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but Ihave this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing thisumm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say onThursday?"
"Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you ifyour actor friend can audition for my movie?"
"Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later. (He runsoff and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)"
"Hey! How’s it goin’?"
"Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes."
"Yes it has! I made cookies!"
"Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potatochips."
"But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven."
"Okay. (Reaches for one.)"
"(pulling the plate back) Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘emin bed, remember? No crumbies!"
"(gritting her teeth) Okay, I’ll be out in a second."
"Okay!"
"(opening the door) What are you doing?"
"That doesn’t lock does it?"
"Oh, Joey! Sorry!"
"No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it."
"Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!"
"Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!"
"Really?"
"Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)"
"I’ve never lived like this before."
"I know."
"All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up andeats it.)"
"What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?"
"Uhh, I can’t."
"Oh, you have some studying to do?"
"No, I have some turning 21 to do."
"Y’know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to…(He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)"
"What are you doing?"
"Nothing, I’m-I’m just, I’m so comfortable with you!"
"Do you not want to be seen with me?"
"What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?"
"Uh no, they’re still here but I think I’m about to leave."
"What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares whatpeople think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong withthat. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.)Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth."
"Hi!"
"Aren’t you in my Popular Culture class?"
"That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’redating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore."
"You are"
"What?"
"They’re gonna fire you! You can’t date a student! It’sagainst the rules."
"Really? Its not just frowned upon?"
"I love it at Joey’s!"
"Hey, here you go. (Hands her another one.)"
"(entering, sees Rachel’s throw) Ni-hi-ice!"
"Thanks!"
"(To Joey) So, you busy Thursday?"
"Oh, very funny. I don’t know if you remember, but my audition wassupposed to be Thursday. (Chandler doesn’t say anything until Joey figures it out.)You got me the audition?! Let’s hug it up! (They hug.)"

"(entering) Hey! Hi!"
"Hi!"
"(To Rachel) Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!"
"Uh-huh."
"Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener startedthe fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tellyou but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s justface it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay atJoey’s."
"No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what?I’m fine here."
"Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you."
"Really?"
"Yeah she said something about crumbies."

"I know. I’m sorry."
"All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wetpaper towels.)"
"Yeah."
"God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monica’s.)"
"Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hotplate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other."
"For what it’s worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. Itfelt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more."
"I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’sagainst the rules. It’s forbidden."
"Wow!"

"Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it’s really hot."
"Really?"
"Yeah."
"Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’swrong."
"Stop it! (She starts to get all worked up.)"
"(feeling it too) No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’snaughty. It’s taboo."
"Shut the book!"
