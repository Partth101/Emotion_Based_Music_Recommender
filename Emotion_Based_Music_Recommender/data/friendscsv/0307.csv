"All right, I have ya. Oh God."
"Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?"
"Oh, it’s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay."
"Gotcha. (he and his helper walk in carrying the racecar bed.)"
"Hi Daddy!"
"This where they put it? What, there no table available in thekitchen! Hello, baby."
"You remember Ross."
"Um-hmm."
"Nice to see you again Dr. Green."
"So! (they both try to sit next to Rachel but Dr. Green issuccessful.) (to Ross) How’s the library?"
"Ugh, museum."
"What happened to the library?"
"There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah,I never worked at one."
"You know what’s really good here, the lobster. What do you sayshall I just order three."
"Yeah, if you’re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was ajoke, I made a joke."
"Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster."
"What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind ofperson that works at a library."
"It’s not a library..."
"(interrupting him) I know!! It’s a museum! What, you’re theonly one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we willhave two lobsters and a menu. (nods at Ross, and mouths I don’t know to the waiter.)"
"So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat."
"They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?"
"It gives it a nice antiquey look."
"(he stares at Ross) Rust, is boat cancer, Ross."
"Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachelgiggles at that)"
"Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night tothe Levines, before we go."
"Okay."
"Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)"
"Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad."
"Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve addedwrong. He only tipped like four percent."
"Yeah. That’s Daddy."
"That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re awaitress."
"Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffeehouse, I’d be serving him sneezers."
"So?"
"So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s notgonna change."
"You really serve people sneezers?"
"Well um,"
"You kids ready?"
"Thanks again, Dr. Green."
"All right."
"Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt."
"Oh, ah, you don’t need that."
"Why not?"
"The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes,the, the ah, night blindness."
"(gets his receipt and notices the twenty) What is this? Who put atwenty down here? Huh?"
"Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way toomuch, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really."
"Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do somethingabout that."
"I know."
"Excuse me, you think I’m cheap?"
"Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he reallydidn’t."
"Nothing I do means anything, really."
"This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put downtwenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?Here, I’ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right. (rips upthe bill, and throws it at Ross, then leaves)"
"Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’."
"Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry asan actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take apair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey thatI’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in myeyebrow and I like it’ (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretendfishhook.) Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is tryand divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that’s how it’s done. Great soapopera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed."
"Hey, Mr. Trib."
"Hey-hey."
"Guess what, I got an audition!"
"Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud."
"I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?"
"You bet! What’s the part?"
"Oh it’s great, it’s a role on"
"You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave italone."
"Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in myfood."
"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans andrubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already."
"Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall."
"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?"
"I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with somethingand she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have toask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?"
"Um. yeah."
"I am"
"All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, ifwe act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice."
"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work."
"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’swhy you have got to be the bigger man here."
"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, Icould be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, exceptthat I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’"
"Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? Forme?"
"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okaywe’re never gonna get along."
"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got aMother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wannahave to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)"
"Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I’ll get the bagels."
"(sees the bed) What’s this?"
"Isn’t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!"
"This is not the bed I ordered!"
"I know, you must’ve won like a contest or something!"
"Phoebe!"
"Why is this car in my bedroom?"
"I’m sorry, okay, I-I wasn’t looking, and the store says thatthey won’t take it back because you signed for it..."
"When did I sign for it?"
"When I was you! Y'know what, it’s all Joey’s fault,‘cause he left his nose open!"
"Did you make brownies today?"
"Knock, knock."
"(to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed."
"Hey, I’m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees thebed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp."
"It’s Monica’s bed. What?"
"Okay. (to Monica) It’s a racecar."
"So. This has always been Monica’s bed, what you’re justnoticing now, how self-involved are you?"
"Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic onthe mattress?"
"Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offersher, her hand to comfort her.)"
"Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas,that’s not gonna be me, not me."
"Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?"
"No."
"Whoa. That was really good."
"Thanks, any suggestions?"
"You told him to play the boxer gay!!"
"Well, I-I might’ve said supergay."
"You totally screwed him over."
"Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?"
"Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want thispart."
"Well, if you really, really want it, then it’s okay."
"(opening the door) Hi Daddy."
"Baby. Ross."
"Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf onit.)"
"Thanks for dinner last night."
"Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson."
"Nice hair. What’d ya do? Swim here?"
"(to Rachel) Okay, that’s it, I can’t take it anymore."
"What? What? He’s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he justwants to know how you got here."
"Oh, please. Sweetie it’s hopeless, okay, I’m just gonna go.(starts to leave rubbing his neck)"
"What?!"
"Look, look I’m sorry. It’s just that...."
"Ross? What’s with the neck?"
"He’s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to mychiropractor..."
"You’re still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn’tget into medical school in Extapa!"
"Thank you! That’s what I keep saying."
"Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor."
"Uh."
"Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?"
"Well that’s his last name."
"And his first name."
"He’s Bobby Bobby?"
"It’s Robert Bobby."
"Oh."
"And um, excuse me, he helps me."
"Oh-ho please. Ask her how?"
"What do you need help for?"
"With my alignment. I’ve got one leg shorter than the other."
"Oh God!"
"Argue with that."
"What? It’s true, my right leg is two inches shorter."
"Come on! You’re just titling! (to Ross) Her legs are fine!"
"I know that!"
"So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?"
"I’m sorry, let her?"
"What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insuranceeither."
"Wait a minute, you don’t have renter’s insurance?!"
"No."
"Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run afterhim with one leg shorter than the other?!"
"Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?"
"I’d love some juice. Thanks."
"Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?"
"Yeah honey, I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tellhim about the mole I haven’t got checked yet."
"Excellent!"
"(sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you’llhave a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in therecent, present. And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor toplay a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turnedout, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he’s got a twoyear contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, meI’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be onTV. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause fromhis students.) Thank you."
"Uh, may I help you?"
"Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuckwith the racecar bed."
"Look, it’s like I told you, there’s nothing I can do. Yousigned for it, Monica Velula Geller."
"All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king."
"Nobody sees the king!"
"Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)"
"Hey! You can’t go back there!"
"Oh my God."
"Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screechingsound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin’! (honks thebed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops)All right, I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring."
