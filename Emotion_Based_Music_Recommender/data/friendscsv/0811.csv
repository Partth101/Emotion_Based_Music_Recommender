"Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we’ve got a lotto celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?"
"I can’t think of anything we’re doing. (Quietly) Whycan’t I think of anything we’re doing?"
"Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keepthrowing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!"
"Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know,we’re not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend anotherevening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?"
"No."
"That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behavedat our engagement party."
"Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts"
"Hi!"
"Hey!"
"Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card.What do you think?"
"Huh. Wow, this is great."
"Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?""
"Well, we-we haven’t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okayto say it to other people."
"How many did you want? I’m getting a hundred."
"A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’mnot sure about the whole uh, card thing."
"Really? Why not?"
"Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know ifwe’re really quite there yet."
"Oh y’know, I didn’t think of it that way. You’re right.You’re right. So, can I ask you a question?"
"Yeah."
"Where are we?"
"Huh."
"Y’know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?"
"Hmm…"
"I mean I love spending time with you, y’know I just—I hopewe’re moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don’t youthink?"
"Let’s do the card!"
"What?"
"The card! I think we’re there!"
"Okay. I—But I think we should still have this conversation."
"Really?! I mean, even with the card?"
"Hi!"
"Hi!"
"Just so you know, Dr. Long can’t be here today, she was called tothe hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you."
"Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guywho took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about, baldhaircut, hairy fingers… (Stops when she realizes it was her.)"
"(entering) Hi Rachel? I’m Dr. Schiff. (By the way, he’s anattractive man.)"
"Yes, you are."
"So, how’s it going?"
"Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where areyou from? What do you do?"
"I’m a doctor."
"Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do youski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?"
"Uh, I don’t have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski."
"Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!"
"So, are you experiencing any discomfort?"
"No. I’m very comfortable."
"Any painful gas?"
"No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!"
"Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?"
"Well would you like me to lie down on the table?"
"I’m sorry, is there something going on here?"
"Do you feel it too?"
"Hi."
"Oh hey! So, how did your doctor’s appointment go?"
"Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in themiddle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple."
"Oh my God."
"Why did you do that?"
"Okay, remember that little problem I was having during myfourth month ofpregnancy?"
"Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up youpractically came on to me."
"You wish."
"Hey, I could’ve had you if I wanted you."
"Oh yeah? Come and get it."
"Okay, even this is turning me on!"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you andMona? Are you guys still together?"
"Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!"
"You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?"
"Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants tohave the conversation about where the relationship is going."
"Ugh! Women!"
"I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? Imean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?""
"Uh Ross? You asked me that."
"Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, Ihate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of agesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talkabout it."
"Like asking her to move in with you?"
"Smaller than that."
"Making her a mixed tape?"
"Uh, bigger than that."
"Give her a key to your apartment."
"Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape."
"All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I loveyou."
"Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but Icould say I looove spending time with you."
"No, we hate that."
"That is a slap in the face."
"Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have theconversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.What do you think Rach?"
"I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipplesthrough that sweater."
"Bing! We’re all set for tonight, 8 o’clock."
"Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work."
"Oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her motherwork. Fine. Tomorrow night then."
"Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either."
"Oh? Why not?"
"It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament."
"What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me orsomething?"
"Well now-now you’re just talking crazy."
"So why can’t the three of us go out together?"
"Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Holdme."
"Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised,I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked atme, pure lust."
"Y’know what would really help me through this tough time ischoking something. Can I choke ya?"
"Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this. Now here’s the plan,grab your coat, we’re going to a strip club."
"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell withthat bitch."
"Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversationabout-about where things are with us."
"Yeah, I-I think I suggested that."
"Aw, we-we are so…(Motions that they’re connected.) So umm, wellI-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you. And I mean-I’mhaving a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides thereisn’t.)"
"Okay."
"I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-ifit’s just fun. It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? Sowhere-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-andthe answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’rethinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’renot getting any younger. No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you"
"I’m sorry, so umm, so where are we?"
"Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young."
"Okay…"
"But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to myapartment. (Hands her his key.)"
"Really?!"
"Really."
"You don’t think this is too fast."
"You gave her a key to your apartment?!"
"Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in avery serious relationship."
"(entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! How’d the conversation go?"
"Oh great, I live on the street."
"Where?! (Ross exits.)"

"You’re welcome."
"Phoebe no!"
"It’s okay, he’s a virgin."
"Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll havesex with you."
"Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone."
"No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just doit with some random guy!"
"Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!(Phoebe exits.)"
"Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lapdance with those girls. Huh?"
"Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl."
"Bing—What’s this?! (Grabs his hand.)"
"It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a"
"No, it’s a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We’re gonna goto the East River right now and throw it in there!"
"Oh no-no-no!"
"Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y’know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot betterand if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head."
"Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I givethem away for no reason at all."
"(entering) Hey Ross, what’s going on? You changing the lock?"
"No. That guy is."
"I don’t understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and thenyou change the lock."
"Good luck buddy. (Exits.)"
"Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you’re-you’resending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?"
"I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape."
"What?"
"I love you!"
"Ohh! (Hugs him.) And I love spending time with you. (Ross isn’thappy.)"
"Hi honey I’m home."
"From the tequila factory?"
"It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him thatyou and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and thenwhen I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!"
"Come here. I can breath through my mouth."
"Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life wouldbe like without you. It was like"
"I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holidaycard this year?"

"Then why did I ask?"
"Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—butlately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put thisumm, erotically charged."
"Is that college talk for horny?"
"Yeah. So y’know, I have all of these feelings and I don’t knowwhat to do about them, because I can’t date like a normal person, which is finebecause I don’t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night.Just sex, y’know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feelcomfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night, I mean isthat really so…hard…to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?"
"Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon."
"Well, I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock."
"Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too."

"You’re Rachel!"
"You’re Joey!"
"You’re my friend!"
"Right back at ya!"
"But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad."
"And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking aboutbecause I didn’t ask you to do anything!"
"I know!"
"Do you wanna do it?"
"No!"
"All right, me neither! I was just testing you!"
"That’s the end of this conversation!"
"This conversation never happened!"
"Never happened! Good night!"
"Good night!"
"Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)"
"Hi. Listen, I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It reallywasn’t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you somethingthat I think you’ll really enjoy.
