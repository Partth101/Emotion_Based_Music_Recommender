"You guys"
"We're so sorry."
"Yeah."
"Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain theunderwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!"
"No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell themyou"
"Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found"

"Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparentlypeople now call you mental."
"(Proudly) Yeah."
"We want you to speak to a psychiatrist."
"Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is allbecause of a sandwich."
"(laughs) A sandwich?"
"Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Hersecret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it theMoist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here…"
"(laughs) Oh, you know what?"
"What?"
"I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that."
"You ate my sandwich?"
"It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone."
"(getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkeysandwich with a Moist Maker?"
"No."
"Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?"
"There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind."
"(getting angry) That said it was"
"Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my stillbe in the trash."
"(jumping to his feet in anger) What?"
"Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of itaway."
"You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!"
"(losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!"
""
"Hi!"
"Hi!"
"(sitting down) So umm, what's this book about?"
"You didn't read this one either?!"
"Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else."
"What?"
""
"No! You should've read it yourself!"
"Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!"
"Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's awoman, but she's not. She's a cyborg."
"A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!"
"Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time."
"(entering) Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what dideverybody think about Jane Eyre?"
"Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some veryinteresting insights."
"Well, go ahead Rachel."
"Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading JaneEyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time."
"If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right."
"Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots."
"Hey."
"Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, Ithought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)"
"(gasps) You're"
"I know."
"Ross?"
"(in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!"
"Ross, are you okay?"
"I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today."
"Why?!"
"On account of my rage."
"Which I may say, right now, is out of control."
"He gave me a pill for it."
"A pill?"
"Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave ofabsence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me atranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it."
"Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?"
"And you're okay with that?"
"I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I,I definitely don't care about my sandwich."
"(entering, angrily) Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe youlet me go on and on like that!"
"(smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing"
"That was"
"Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously."
"Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to besomething we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!"
"Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know,people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to highschool."
"Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I justwanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?"
"(yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!"
"Monica, you"
"(sees the picture) Oh my God! That's Monica!!"
"Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!"
"You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!"
"(entering, with the rest of the gang) What's going on?"
"Joey has got a secret peephole!"
"(Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)"
"Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us!And then he eats chicken and looks at them!"
"Look! (Shows Ross the picture.)"
"(covering his eyes) Dude! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of thegang.)"
"(grabbing the picture) Give me that!"
"All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's giveour friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!"
"No! I am"
"All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this."
"Thank you!"
"Joey's a sex addict."
"What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleadingwith Joey to go along with it.) No I'm not!!"
"It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!"
"No! No! I am"
"Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!"
"No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!"
"Well, what is the truth?"
"Yeah, what's going on?"
"What's going on?"
"(thinking) I slept with Monica."
"Well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?"
"Oh no!"
"You slept with my sister?"
"Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London."
"This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)"
"Monica, is this true?"
"Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that'sbeen going on?"
"Yes it's true."
"Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found yourunderwear in our apartment the other day?"
"Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.Right Monica?"
"I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir."
"My God Monica!!"
"Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?"
"No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has beentrying to get me back in the sack ever since London!"
"So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself."
"That makes sense!"
"And the video camera?"
"Uhh, Monica?"
"I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey."
"But sadly I could not be enticed."
"Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would youdo that?!"
"I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants."
"Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who'snot. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, sothe chicken's up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)"
"I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you gotcut off."
"Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?"
"I don't know! I didn't come with her!"
"(entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I justconvinced Paul to give us a test next week!"
"A test?!!"
"Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! (Running out) Weshould have essay questions!!"
