"(lying on a beach towel, recapping what happened in the last episode)Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her momand dad, and I don’t really know what happened with that."
"(to Phoebe) I’m your mother."
"Ehh?"
"(voice-over) Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn’t go out witha guy like Chandler..."
"(to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head awayin disgust)"
"(voice-over) ...and he couldn’t let it go, and... I don’t reallyknow what happened with that either."
"(voice-over) Oh-oh! And then Ross’s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows upand Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross hasto choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don’t know what happened thereeither..."
"Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. (gets up and leaves.)"
"(surprised) Hi!"
"Hi!"
"Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned."
"Awww."
"(to Rachel) Thanks a million."
"Oh, you’re welcome a million."
"(getting up and leaving) (to Ross) Okay, I’ll see you in our room."
"Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)"
"(softly) Oh my God."
"I know."
"(stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go."
"Whoa! What?! Why?!"
"Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie."
"Here?! Now?!"
"Well, yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night, and if I go inthere she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff."
"Well, can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood?"
"No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either, Ican’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her..."
"(interrupting) Whoa-ho."
"Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?"
"I don’t know."
"Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasn’t every morning."
"Oh, making it worse!"
"Okay."
"So I guess you’d like to know how it all happened."
"I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born,and everyone started lying their asses off!"
"Noo! No! It wasn’t like that I... Remember how I told you howLily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close."
"How close?"
"Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple."
"I don’t even know how that would work!"
"Well, we were..."
"(interrupting) I’m not asking!"
"Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I wasstupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it’s like tobe eighteen years old?"
"Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off,and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand."
"Well, I’m so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the bestparents in the world, I didn’t even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of yearsago, and by then you were already grown up. I don’t know, you’re here, and Iwould, I would really, I would like to get to know you."
"Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'knowyou had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y'know what, you walkedout on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you."
"Wait!"
"I don’t"
"(walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, where’s mypurse?"
"(closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! We’re out of soda."
"(jumping up) Oh, I’ll go out and get you some."
"Really?!"
"Nope! Because I’m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, who’sentering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?"
"Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom."
"I found a dried up seashores."
"Sweety, what are you talking about?"
"Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner! (starts to goupstairs)"
"Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don’t you wanna stay here and talkabout it?"
"No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone."
"(turning around, insistently) Monica!"
"Oh."
"It’s over."
"Oh, was it awful?"
"Well, it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was, until Inoticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stopthemselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left."
"I wrote you a letter."
"Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turnsaway.)"
"(handing him the letter) It’s just some things I’ve beenthinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of usgetting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff."
"Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing himfrom making contact.) Wow, it’s-it’s 5:30 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So,I’d better get cracking on this baby."
"Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done."
"Okay, I’ll be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back.Very exciting."
"Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumesreading the letter)"
"(coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts theletter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Whydidn’t you come up?"
"Done!"
"You just finished?"
"Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, veryimportant to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!"
"So umm, does it?"
"I’m sorry."
"Does it?"
"Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’part just another glance."
"What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even"
"(interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t"
"Are you sure?"
"Oh, sure! I’m sure."
"I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away fromthe letter.)"
"All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man onEarth. Would you go out with me?"
"Ennnh."
"I’ve got canned goods."
"(jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, youguys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Checkthis baby out, dug me a hole!"
"Excellent hole, Joe."
"Oh no! No!! My hole!!"
"(screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!"
"(climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!"
"Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!"
"Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!"
"It’s like two miles!"
"Yeah, and I’m a little tired from digging the hole."
"Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!"
"We’ve got to do something!"
"Well, there’s really only one thing you can do."
"What?! What is it?!"
"You’re gonna have to pee on it."
"What?!! Gross!!"
"Don’t blame me, I saw it on"
"Y'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammoniain that, that like kills the pain."
"Well forget it! It doesn’t hurt that (tries to take a step)"
"If you want some privacy you can use my hole."
"Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachelcuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod ‘Yes.’) Ohh!That’s so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod ‘No.’) But for you, yay!Ohh."
"Hey!"
"How was the beach?"
"Nothing, I don’t know."
"What happened?"
"Nothing. I’m gonna take a shower."
"Me too!!"
"Me too."
"Okay, I’m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car."
"Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?"
"It does. It really and truly does."
"(finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does"
"She wants"
"Oh my God! If you say that one more time,"
"Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she sayshere, (reading from the letter) “If you accept full responsibility...” (toChandler and Joey) Full responsibility! “...I can begin to trust you again. Does thatseem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!”"
"No?"
"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel. Ifyou bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you."
"(calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you’re right. Yeah I guessI’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this."
"Sure, it’s hard to forget! But that doesn’t mean you have totalk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler)ever talk about."
"What the hell happened on that beach?!"
"It’s between us and the sea, Ross!"
"(to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula."
"Hey!"
"Okay, well umm, I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, butumm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom."
"Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm."
"(shocked) You know her?!"
"No, I umm, I read about her in Mom’s suicide note."
"There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods ‘Yes.’) Well, doyou still have it?"
"(disgusted) Hang on. (She goes into her apartment and slams the door inPhoebe’s face.)"
"I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!"
"Yeah. So how have you been doing?"
"I, umm, shut up!"
"(reading from the note) “Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll missyou. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!"
"Well, it’s pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. Youread the poem, right?"
"Noooo!!"
"All right, hang on! (She takes the note, goes back into her apartmentand slams the door shut.)"
"Pass the cheese, please."
"My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?"
"Nope."
"(jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!"
"No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk."
"I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us."
"(coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you thinkabout making that beach trip an annual thing?"
"NO!!!"
"All right, that’s it, you guys! What happened out there?"
"What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all overme."
"Come on!"
"What happened? Joey?"
"All right. (gets up)"
"(stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we’d never tell!"
"(running over and joining Monica) They’ll never understand!"
"Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It’s eating mealive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish."
"(interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the livingroom) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn’t stand. I-I couldn’t walk."
"(following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone.We didn’t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica’sshoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)"
"I was in too much pain."
"And I was tired from digging the huge hole!"
"And then Joey remembered something."
"I’d seen this thing on"
"Wait a minute! I saw that! On"
"Ewwww!!"
"You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought Iwas gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way.So... (looks at Joey.)"
"(turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!"
"That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help!And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn’t. I got thestage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned toChandler."
"(wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, “Do itnow! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here thescreaming."
"(laughs) That’s ‘cause sometimes I just do it through my wall tofreak you out."
"(singing) “...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of mybedroommmm.” (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count thecolours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you.You go away."
"I’ll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that therehasn’t been a day where I didn’t regret giving you up."
"Okay, bye."
"No, I’m not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, thereason I didn’t look you up was, well I was afraid that you’d react, just welllike, the way, the way you’re reacting right now, and can’t we just, y'know,start from here?"

"Ohh, so cute."
"Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you."
"I know. I’m mad at me too."
"Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry."
"Hey! Me too!"
"All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out."
"Oh-hooo, I missed you."
"I missed you too."
"Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up toeverything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?"
"(getting miffed) I suppose."
"You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom"
"(getting angry) Umm-hmm."
"Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time waswhat you needed just to gain a little perspective..."
