"Yeah, actually that’s my roommate’s."
"I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy."
"Ah yes, but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watchyourself."
"Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?"
"Hm-mmm."
"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?"
"(laughs) Yeah, but I’m pretty sure he’s gay."
"No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Comeon!"
"…which brings us back, of course, to Greely’s theory of dominance.(The bell rings.) Okay, that-that’s all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where theFreeman building is?"
"Yeah, it’s the new building on Avenue A."
"What?! That-that’s all the way cross town, I’m supposed to teacha graduate seminar there in ten minutes."

"Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?"
"There’s a side of steamed vegetables."
"Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitutethe three-pound lobster?"
"Y’know what? Bring her both, and I’ll have the same. (Thewaitress leaves.)"
"Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh, I almostforgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check."
"Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We’re on a date."
"Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So doyou have any moves?"
"No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don’t like me for—(Laughs.)I’m sorry I couldn’t even get through that."
"I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves."
"Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of winesent to my table from a fan."
"Oh my God. And that works?!"
"Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, Ijust want to have a normal life!""
"Oh, you poor little famous man."
"Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the nightto kiss you, but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can."
"(looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leanedin. I really almost did!"
"Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves."
"Alright. So where’d you grow up?"
"That’s your move? Boy Rach, you’re lucky you’re hot."
"Come on, just answer the question!"
"(exasperated) Queens."
"And so were-were you close to your parents?"
"Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad."
"Why not?"
"I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distancey’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there, but it is."
"(sympathetic) Oh. (Starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) It’sgotta be rough."
"Yeah, it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes Ithink—Wow!! Nice move!"
"Huh?"
""Where’d you grow up," it’s so simple!"
"Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go to the restroom."
"Yeah."
"And now you’re watching me walk away."
"Yes I am! Again so simple!"
"Hey."
"You are not going to believe what I did today!"
"Well it clearly wasn’t showering or shaving."
"I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! Theyshould change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. (Pause) Although I-I hope they don’t."
"Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played"
"Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off theboard! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five, only he can’tstraighten his fingers.)"
"What is the matter with your hand?"
"Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosenup. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirtywords."
"Chandler, why would you do that?"
"Because it’s awesome."
"You think this is clever?"
"Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S itis a bit of a challenge."
"Hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty."
"It is when you put it together with that one."
"Ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting oneof those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, thiscan’t be there."
"Come on, he won’t even know what they mean."
"Chandler! He’s seven; he’s not stupid."
"Have you talked to him lately?"
"All right, look I’m just gonna unplug it."
"No-no-no, if you unplug it, I’ll have nothing to show for my day!It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look atthat! Look at that, it’s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM(Read Only Memory, it’s a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!"
"Honey you-you got to beat your scores!"
"With the claw?!"
"All right fine. Fine, I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get thisoff the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger."
"(smiles) Pull my finger—(Looks at his hand)—My hand ismessed up."
"I am not gonna answer that!"
"Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross ifyou had to, if you had to, who would you punch?"
"No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them."
"Chandler?"
"Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such awonderful time!"
"Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!"
"I know!"
"I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?"
"Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose."
"I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date somuch."
"Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before."
"Huh. Huh."
"All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my dateleaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan."
"Ah! Okay, well then you don’t judge me. I’m gonna suck on thecellophane from the brownie I had before. (They both do as they planned.)"
"So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?"
"Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lipslook irresistible."
"How do you do that?"
"Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm."
"Oh my God!"
"Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so nowyou go."
"No, I don’t want to tell you."
"Why not?"
"Because it’s embarrassing."
"More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (Rachel just looks athim.) I didn’t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, justtell me!"
"(laughs) Okay. All right, stand up. (They do so.) Well, when we’reat the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for asecond, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesn’t soundlike anything, but I swear it works."
"(stunned and turned on) Yeah. Why—Yeah, that would work for ya…"
"All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time."
"Oh. (She kisses him.) Yeah. (She goes into her room.) Me to. (He thenstarts to freak out.)"
"…you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!"
"No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding thephrase, "Get the hell out of my way!""
"Well, why didn’t you just take a cab?"
"Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streetsit’ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I?Rockefeller?"
"Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this."
"Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t, they’ll take the class awayfrom me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter."
"You what?"
"You’ve seen it, the Geller Yeller."
"Right. Wow!"
"Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I’m sure I canmake it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit bycars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)"
"Hey!"
"Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie"
"Oh yeah, I still can’t believe you haven’t seen"
"Relax! It’s not like it’s"

"Oh yeah? All right, let’s do it tonight."
"Well don’t you have that big date tonight?"
"Oh right!"
"Hey Joey, can I ask you something?"
"Yeah."
"After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?"
"Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!"
"I don’t know! (Pause) I’m-I’m kinda thinking it-it wasthe lobster…"
"Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster."
"Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night."
"Yeah me too, all night."
"Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?"
"Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, youdon’t want to look in my hamper."
"Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back overhere. All right, come on"

"I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price."
"But Ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this."
"Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They bothlook at him.) Was it just me?!"
"Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I’m on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from astudent, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.)
