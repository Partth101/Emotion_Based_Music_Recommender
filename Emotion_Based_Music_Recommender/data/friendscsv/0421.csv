"Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean youdon’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks."
"You think?"
"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, andyou’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."

"See, he's her lobster."
"(seeing the decision) Nooooo. You’re really not going?"
"Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean, it’sRoss. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just, it’s for the best,y’know it is, it’s… Y’know, plus, somebody’s got to stay herewith Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone tohelp her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour."
"You don’t have a car. And your license expired."
"I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I haveso little time to do it in."
"All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here thatthere’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from thebook.) "It’s almost as good as being there.""
"It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!"
"Well, You could, but... probably just the onetime."
"I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in ourhotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!"
"If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard."
"Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!"
