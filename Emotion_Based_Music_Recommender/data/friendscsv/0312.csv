"Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)"
"(to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?"
"What?"
"Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don'twrite trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"You don't even know me..."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you."
"What?"
"The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that youwould think this."
"I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe..."
"No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?"
"(sarcastically) Oh yeah."
"All right, let's do it!"
"No, no, no. What was that?"

"Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?"
"Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now ifit's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm notgonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away."
"Let it be me! Let it be me!"
"Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two peoplelove each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (shekisses him)"
"I gotta get going. Bye Chandler."
"Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can youpick me up some porn?"
"Where ya going?"

"Ahh, no."
"Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.)"
"Are you jealous?"
"Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. Imean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?"
