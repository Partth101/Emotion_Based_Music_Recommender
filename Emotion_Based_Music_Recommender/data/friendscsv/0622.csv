"Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk."
"Daddy!"
"You’re next!!"
"Okay. I didn’t know he was here. (Runs over to Rachel.)"
"Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from mydaughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come upto my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!""
"Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain…"
"No, let me explain! Fired!!"

"(panicked) What?"
"And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimicsPaul’s flexing.)"
"Ross, let me show you where the guest room is."
"(going over to him) I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out."
"I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman namedHeldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one ofthose Chandler noises.)"
"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our namesdown for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?"
"Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)"
"Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebeand Rachel…"
"Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before mewere you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 whoare available by the way!"
"It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, becauseit doesn’t."
"Okay."
"Really?"
"Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know thatI’m just not ready…"
"I know! I know."
"Okay. (They hug.)"
"I’m gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that you’re back. I wasreally worried about you. (Exits.)"
"(entering from her room) Hey, did she buy it?"
"Totally."
"So did Heldi show you the place?"
"Yeah, it’s beautiful."
"I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!"
"I know."
"Hey Gunther."
"Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there(points) wants the biscotti."
"Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go."
"Do you still work here?"
"No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to you that one?I’m sorry."
"Oh that’s cool, I was gonna fire you anyway."
"Great! (Takes his coffee and leaves.)"
