"How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?"
"Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani."
"Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such anice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?"

"Hey does anyone have any gum?"
"Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it andtaking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh, y’know what? No.(Pause) Wait a second. (She removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimmingin it.) I know it’s in here somewhere."

"Honey, no one thinks you’re a pansy, but we do think you need atissue. (She notices something hanging from Monica’s nose, as does Joey.)"
"(wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.)"
"I’m gonna grab you some tissue."
"I don’t need a tissue! I’m fine-d!"
"When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’renot fine."
"I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know, it’s a really hardword to say."
"Yes?"
"Hi, is Rachel here? I’m her sister."
"Oh my God, Jill!"
"Oh my God, Rachel!"

"(To Ross) Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one orthat’s bitter?"
"(To Rachel) Daddy cut me off."
"Never mind, I got it."
"And y’know what I said to him? "I’m gonna hire a lawyer andI’m gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I’m gonna cut you off!""
"Wow! What did he say?"
"That he wouldn’t pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here andlearn about the value of money from the one daughter he’s actually proud off."
"Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proudof me."
"Rach? (Points to Jill.)"
"Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut youoff?"
"Okay, I bought a boat."
"You bought a boat?"
"Yeah but it wasn’t for me, it was for a friend."
"Boy did"
"Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve everhappened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I didit, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad isproud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get ajob, you’re gonna get an apartment, and then I’ll help you and you can stay withus. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?"
"Of course, yeah!"
"Oh, that’s so great! Okay, I’m really gonna do this! Idon’t know how to thank you guys."
"Ooh, I like cards."
"(to a customer) Are you all finished here?"
"Yes."
"Great! (Joey takes his cookie and finishes it.)"
"Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, andJoey owes eight dollars."
"What?!"
"For all the free food you gave away."
"Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it?"
"We don’t give anything away unless it’s someone’sbirthday."
"Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?"
"No!"
"(to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) Sorry! (He grabs hermuffin away and returns it to the serving tray.)"
"(entering, carrying a bunch of shopping bags) I just had the hardest day.Those bags are so heavy. (Sets them down.)"
"Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away yourcredit card."
"Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all thecool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! (Holds up a red sweater) This is my "Please, hireme" sweater. (Holds up a pair of black pants) And these are my, "Don’t youwant to rent me this apartment?" pants."
"I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as makingit on your own."
"Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!"
"Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea."
"So who made her queen of the world?"
"I would"
"(entering) Hey! What’s goin’ on?"
"Hey!"
"(notices Jill’s bags) Jill! Did you shop?!"
"No! They did! (Points to Phoebe and Ross)"
"You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded itright under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys areterrible!"
"Sorry Jill."
"Sorry-sorry Jill."
"What’d you get?"

"Oh, come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that!"
"Right! But, I"
"All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’tlet it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I"
"She took all my stuff."
"Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)"
"(gasps) That’s the best one! Oh my God, (hugs him) thank you so much!"
"Well. Hey…"
"Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!"
"Oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) "I’msorry!""
"(hits him) Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!"

"I know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass oforange juice.)"
"Okay, I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed, thenyou’re coming with me."
"That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippyhere. (Points to his nose.)"
"(wiping her nose) Are you saying that you don’t wanna get withthis? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesn’t work all that well with thebig robe.)"
"Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy."
"(in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)"
"Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I justcan’t have sex with a sick person."
"I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sickperson either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. Weare two healthy people in the pribe of libe."
"That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe ofmwha-ah-libe."

"What’s up?!"
"Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know."
"Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I justpitched the idea to my boss at"
"No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after youleft and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them."

"With Ross and Jill?"
"Yeah!"
"With Ross and my sister?"
"Yeah."
"With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?"
"Yeah."
"Oh there is no way."

Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh thisis just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—Idon’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is thatshe wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister,this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened tome."
"But"
"That’ll be $3.85."
"What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!"
"It’s just I can’t because my manager said I… (Gets an idea)(Starts singing) "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dearAnnie…"

"Fine, then let’s just say he’s not my type."
"What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What thosethings aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!"
"Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I’ll ask him out."

"Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I’m not sick! Iwanna make you feel, as good as I feel. (Sneezes.)"
"Would you please get some rest!"

"(singing) "Happy birthday to you!""
"You’re paying for that."
"What? No-no it’s her birthday!"
"You’ve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!"
"But it really…"

"Not now, I’m sick!"
"Oh come on you big faker!"
