"I was not flirting."
"It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney,nasally noises.)""

"Yeah, right."
"You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to movetowards Ross.)"
"(backing away) I'm good."
"I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on"
"I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?"

"And on your anniversary, for shame!"
"What's going on?"
"Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!"
"I was not and oh God, shh!"

"Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements."
"(looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okayRoss, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!"
"This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and whenshe does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat."
"See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone."
"(entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! Youremember my grandmother!"
"Big night!"
"This is so cool!"
"So, Joey on"
"Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English."
"I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She juststares at him.) I've done it again."
"She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that'sbelieved in me."
"Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so…"

"Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)"
"So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night inLondon…"
"Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)"
"Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?"
"The one that doesn't."
"That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready."
"Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?"
"That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special."

"(She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!"
"Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?"
"Oh what, you-you want both of them?"
"Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!"
"Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. Iknow it's in the apartment, but I"

"Tell her to wear her own earrings."
"These"
"Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrowher stuff!"
"Why not?"
"Because I lose her stuff!"

"It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine."
"Really?!"
"Really?!"
"It's no big deal, I do it all the time."
"(starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt withguys all the time?"
"Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't meananything with you!"
"Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a"
"(walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.)"
"Chandler, this actually bothers you?"
"Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people.Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with otherwomen?"
"Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women."
"And thank you, for that."
"But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was neververy good at the flirting thing."
"What? (Mumbles) What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you."
"Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then"
"All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going toorder another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt.Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! (To Chandler) And not the one on the menu!"

"Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things aredifferent for men and for women."
"Go on, teach me something about men and women."
"Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See whenyou flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy isthinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!""
"No way!"
"It's true."
"Well that's pathetic!"
"Again true."
"And this goes for all guys?"
"All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guysfrom the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way."
"(To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I stillhaven't told her!"
"Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like (checks his watch)ten minutes left!"

"Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me."
"Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)"
"(entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe givesher the one-minute sign.)"
"(To Rachel) What are we going to do?!"
"I don't know, I don't know."
"All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all."
"Oh gosh, she's going to kill me."
"I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault."
"Ohh that'd be great!"
"Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?"
"Yeah, what is it?"
"Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!"
