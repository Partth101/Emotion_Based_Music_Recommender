"Yeah you are baby."
"Three down knows I’m married, what’s three down doin’?"
"So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?"
"No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me,but I said no."
"Why’d you say no?"
"Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said Iwrite a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall downthe elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time."
"If"
"Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plusy’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! Andif you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?"
"Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?"
"Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?"
"Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the nexttable so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid."
"Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know."
"Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal palRachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in"
"Yeah."
"I really appreciate you taking the time to do this."
"Oh, not at all. Happy to do it."
"(To Chandler) You think we’re being obvious?"
"No, we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk likethis. (Out of the sides of their mouths.)"
"(To Joey) Y’know I think its great you wanted to meethere. Y’know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to abig fancy restaurant."
"(laughs) Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it.Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food."
"Can I get you anything?"
"Umm, I’ll have a cup of coffee."
"And I’ll have all the muffins."
"(entering) Hey!"
"Shhh! We’re not talking."
"Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.)"
"So, according to your bio, you’ve done quite a bit of workbefore"
"Well, there are so many things, it’s hard to pick just one."
"I’m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?"
"Oh yeah, I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea."
"Uh, double latte, extra foam."
"And a bagel with only…"
"(interrupting him) I was just being polite!"
"Okay, how about when you’re not working. What do you do inyour spare time?"
"In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I’m also a mento forthe kids.(The gang shake their heads.) Y’know a mento, a role model. (Chandler biteshis fist to keep from talking.)"
"A mento…"
"Right."
"Like the candy?"
"Matter of fact, I do."
"Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is howour soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?"
"Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise."
"Yeah!"
"Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!"
"It tastes like feet!"
"Uhh, I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know, justeverything in moderation."
"Your muffins. (Sets down a huge plate of muffins in front ofJoey.)"
"I’ll take those to go. (To the interviewer) For the kids."
"Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show yearsago and then they killed you off. What happened there?"
"It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’thave said. But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today."
"Understood. So, what’d you say back then?"
"Well, I said that I… (The gang jumps up and interrupts him.)"
"You guys, this is Shelley, she’s interviewing me for"
"(interrupting him) Hi! I’m gal pal Rachel Green, and if you wantthe dirt, I’m the one you come too. This might be Joey’s baby (rubbing herstomach), who knows? I’m just kidding—Seriously, (leans into the cassetterecorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green."
"(leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of herunborn child."
"Umm, I’m gonna just go get this warmed up. (She takes hercoffee mug up to the counter.)"
"Okay."
"Joey! You’re doing great!"
"Yeah, so far nothing stupid."
"Mento?"
"No thanks."
"(returning) So, as Joey’s friends, is there anything thatyou guys think our readers ought to know?"
"Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy."
"(scoffs at him) Yeah, that’s gonna get you into"
"Umm, I…I just think you don’t expect someone so hot to be sosweet."
"Oh! I like that. What’s your name?"
"Umm, Phoebe Buffay."
"How do you spell that? So we can get it right."
"Oh okay, it’s P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as inebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in (In an Australian accent) ‘Ello there mate!"

"Thanks."
"Bye. (They resume their previous positions.)"
"So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you sayis your best friend?"
"How come you have two?"
"Oh, Joey! Sorry!"
"No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it."
"Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!"
"Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!"
"Really?"
"Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)"
"I’ve never lived like this before."
"I know."
"All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up andeats it.)"
"All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wannabe a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes(kisses Joey)."
"Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and Ididn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl."
"Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends."
"So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a hugegay fan base?"
"Really? Me? Wow! I don’t even know any huge gay people!"
"It hurts me. It physically hurts me."
"Now, off the record, you’re not…"
"What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it justlooked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all yourstuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!"
"Your make-up!"
"Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face toface or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face."
"I think face to face."
"I would say that."
"Face to face, yeah!"
"Okay, here I go."
"All right."
"(grunting) Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!"
"I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a littleholiday weight."
"Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think wethought it all the way through."
"Great nap."
"It really was."
"Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.(Chandler and Ross look at each other.)"
"So, let’s talk about women. I’m sure our femalereaders will be interested to know about your romantic life."
"Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say,"Hey, how you doin’?""
"Oh, please!"
"(to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?"
"Hey! How you doin’?"
"(to her friend) He has the most amazing Porsche under there!"
"I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.(The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then thesame guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapsesit. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)"
"Hi, is Rachel here? I’m her sister."
"Oh my God, Jill!"
"Oh my God, Rachel!"
"Oh my God, introduce us!"
"This is Chandler. (Points at him.)"
"Hi!"
"And you know Monica and Ross!"
"Hi Jill."
"And that’s Phoebe (points), and that’s Joey."
"Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin’?"
"Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.)"
"No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommateand your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you."
"Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on."
"I don't think so."
"Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?"
"I'm okay."
"What?!?! Oh dear God!"
"Not much to tell there I’m really shy."
"So, that’s it. I guess that’s all I need. Thank youso much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month."
"Oh great! Great! Thank you. (They shake hands.)"
"Bye."
"Bye-bye. (The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of thegang.) I did it!"
"Yeah!"
"Amazing! Amazing!"
"(returning) Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybodythis. Other than"
"Oh, I don’t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y’know?"
"Thank you. The readers at"
"Oh, good to know. (The interviewer leaves.) So close!"
"Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where yousaid you didn’t watch soap operas."
"Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She waspretty nice about that."
"You slept with her didn’t you?"
"Little bit, yeah."
"Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy."
"Oh yeah, that’s just a little something for my huge gay fan base.(Winks at him.)"
