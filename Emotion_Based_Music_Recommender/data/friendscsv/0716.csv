"Yeah? You like that one?"
"Yeah, you’re funny."
"I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these!Umm, oh hear—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take aquarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge.

"What is it?"
"It’s Hexadrin."
"Oh no, I don’t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just applypressure to these points right here. (She’s pinching the bit of skin between herright thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and youstill have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)"

"Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on therefor legal reasons!"
"Why?"
"In case it happens."
"(entering) Hey!"

"You did it! You got ordained?!"
"Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!"
"Our minister…"
"I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)"
"Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of hertorso.)"
"Okay, then I must be disoriented."
"Anyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony,do you wanna hear it?"

"It is a love based on giving and receiving.As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared andreceived. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." (Phoebe nodsher approval.) "We too can share and love and have and receive.""
"(To Monica) Should we call the spitter?"
"Hey Rachel! (The camera cuts to her face and we see that Ben pulled thequarter trick with her as well.)"
"Hi!"
"What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?"

"(jumping up from behind her chair) Gotcha!! (Rachel jumps up startled.)"
"I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on thecoffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to youokay?"
"(from the kitchen) Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?"
"Yes oh—(To Ben)—Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.)No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all thatstuff I taught you yesterday?"

"Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going tohappen to you! Stop being such a baby!"
"Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!(Holds up the warning label.)"
"Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?"
"Yeah. O-okay."
"(reading) "When I think of the love that these two givers andreceivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving andgiving and…" And then I can’t think of a good word for right here. (Hepoints to the stop on the paper where he left off.)"
"How about receiving?"
"Yes!"
"See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool thingsabout having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us!Y’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!"
"Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh sohard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?"
"No, not us… (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)"
"I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a wholeanything?"
"Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from theeyes?"
"It doesn’t say that!"
"Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!"
"See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romanticstories. Nice stories."
"Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’knowwhen you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, "Begantheir beautiful journey…""

"Joe?"
"Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meetacross the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub togetherand she’s feeding you strawberries?"
"Isn’t that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?"
"Yeah!! I call that London style."
"No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sadthat night because this guy that I was Ross’s mom."

"Well, not anymore."
"But we don’t do that."
"I know, I just thought it would be fun."
"How drunk are you?"
"Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that youshould feel guilty about taking advantage."
"(thinks) That’s the perfect amount!"
"Okay!"
"(breaking the kiss) Y’know what’s weird?"
"What?"
"This doesn’t feel weird!"
"I know."
"You’re a really good kisser."
"Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wannaget under the covers?"
"Hm-hmm!"

"No I-I-I’m fine."
"All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)"
"That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought youwere on to something, but it did nothing for me."
"Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s"

"(To Joey) Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now.Okay?"
"What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with mybride’s maid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?! (To Monica) Imean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out ofthis, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!"

"Chandler, come on nothing even happened!"
"Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding…"
"No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I except that. I don’tcare about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset."
"How can I not be upset? Okay? I"

It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guysare perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and itjust…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever."
"That’s what you should say."
"What?"
"When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say."
"Really? I can do it?"
"I’d love it if you would do it."
"Hey! (They hug.)"
"But those are the words! Those"
"Well I don’t know remember exactly but, it’s-it’s prettymuch about having and giving and sharing and receiving."
"Hey!"
"Hey!"

"Hey!"
"Hey-hey."
"So are guys doing okay?"
"Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a littlebit and some things in life are more important."
"Yeah baby! (Phoebe and Joey nod.)"
"I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking whatwould happen if-if you two (Points to Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up."
