"(entering) Hi guys!"
"Hey, Pheebs! Hi!"
"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?"
"Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do thisagain!'"
"Ohh. Ouch."
"What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?"
"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You willnever see me naked'."
"Since when?"
"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means'It is you'."
"Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearingalcoholics and complaining about them to you'."
"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha,I already am'."
"And everybody knows this?"
"Yeah. Cushions the blow."
"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog tosleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm."
"That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, sendour dog off to live on a farm."
"Uh, Ross."
"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they hadthis unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was-it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!"
""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?""
""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have tolive with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.""
"Hey, that was really good!"
"Thanks! Let's keep going."
"Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?""
""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I cansmoke.""
""Smoke away.""
"I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone."
"What?"
"Relax your hand!"
"Not so much!"
"Whoah!"
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Alright, now try taking a puff."
"Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me."
"No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette."
"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here."
"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's beenmissing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete."
"Y'miss it?"
"Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my..God. (He continues to smoke.)"
"No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of aguy's thumb to the tip of his index finger."
"That's ridiculous!"
"Can I use.. either thumb?"
"(carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!(Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an icedtea. I'm getting pretty good at this!"
"Yeah. Yeah, excellent."
"(leaving to serve others) Good for me!"
"Y'okay, Phoebe?"
"Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank."
"What did they do to you?"
"It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open uptheir monthly, you know, STATEMENT-"
"Easy."
"- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account."
"Oh, Satan's minions at work again..."
"Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them."
"What are you talking about? Keep it!"
"It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be likestealing."
"Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!"
"Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you knowwhat I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I washappy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine,not-not-mine'..."
"We're with you. We got it."
"Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like thisgiant karmic debt."
"Chandler, what are you doing?"
"(puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?"
"Oh! Oh, God!"
"What is this?!"
"I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking."
"Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!"
"And this- is my reward!"
"Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the lasttime you quit."
"Okay, so this time I won't quit!"
"Ohhh! Put it out!"
"All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it inPhoebe's coffee.)"
"Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!"
"Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date."
"This Alan again? How's it goin'?"
"'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun."
"So when do we get to meet the guy?"
"Let's see, today's Monday... Never."
"Oh, come on! Come on!"
"No. Not after what happened with Steve."
"What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!..Sorry."
"Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chanceto figure that out."
"Well, then can we meet him?"
"Nope. Schhorry."
"I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, andwithin five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off theweak members of the herd."
"Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'lltell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're justlooking out after you."
"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actuallyliked."
"Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer ifthey never get to meet the guy.."
"Let it go, Ross."
"Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi."
"Do you all promise?"
"Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!"
"(shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?"
"You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!"
"Hey, Pheebs."
"'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We havecredited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, andhope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -"
"What bank is this?"
"Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it?"
"(on the intercom) It's Alan."
"(shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here!"
"(to all) Okay, please be good,"
"Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan."
"Hi."
"Hi, Alan."
"I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!"
"(to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay.Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?"
"C'mon!"
"...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, Ican't do this, can't do this. We loved him."
"Loved him! Yeah! He's great!"
"Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that"
"Yeah!"
"And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.)"
"(reluctantly) Yeah."
"Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked."
"Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!"
"...What shoe?"
"From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crookedsmile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'"
"...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all futureboyfriends will be measured."
"What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it."
"Really!"
"Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone.You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)"
"You know what I like most about him, though?"
"What?"
"The way he makes me feel about myself."
"Yeah..."
"Hi.. how was the game?"
"Well.."
"WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!"
"Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?"
"Alan."
"He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon whereBugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,second base-Alan, third base-..."
"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team."
"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two aboutsoftball.."
"Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe..sometimes.."
"What?"
"..I dunno, a little too Alan?"
"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan."
"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore."
"I personally could have a gallon of Alan."
"Hey, Lizzie."
"Hey, Weird Girl."
"I brought you alphabet soup."
"Did you pick out the vowels?"
"Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh,I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.)"
"Saltines?"
"No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?"
"What? (She opens the envelope Phoebe has given her.) Oh my God, there'sreally money in here."
"I know."
"Weird Girl, what are you doing?"
"No, I want you to have it. I don't want it."
"No, no, I ha-I have to give you something."
"Oh, that's fine, no."
"Would you like my tin-foil hat?"
"No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks."
"Please, let me do something."
"Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?"
"Okay."
"Okay."
"Keep the change. (To Phoebe) Sure you don't wanna pretzel?"
"No, I'm fine."
"(leaves) See ya."
"Huh!"
"A"
"Eww!"
"I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there,like this tiny little hitch-hiker!"
"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?"
"Does, um, anyone wanna see?"
"Nooo!"
"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!"
"It's worse than the thumb!"
"Hey, this is so unfair!"
"Oh, why is it unfair?"
"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-crackingisn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, withthat snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all thoseflaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
"...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?"
"Well, I-I could live without it."
"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews herhair?"
"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
"Oh, (Imitating Ross) "you do, do you"?"
"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly."
""Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work."
"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."
"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on."
"Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?"
"No."
"Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like."
"Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow gotthrough!"
"Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel"
"Honey.. you should always feel"
"I know.. it's gonna be really hard."
"Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it."
"No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about."
"Do you have any respect for your body?"
"Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?"
"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and youremphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
"(holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants tospeak to you."
"Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, shetold you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it'snot that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like thatbefore. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)"
"(to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good."
"If only he were a woman."
"Yeah."
"Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand forthirty years it'd be talking too."
"Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.)"
"(entering) Hey. Where's Joey?"
"Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that waswrong?"
"I think he's across the hall."
"Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.)"
"(finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go."
"(deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now."
"Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?"
"Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?"
"Hey, I might!"
"Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollarsfor the thumb."
"You're kidding. Oh my God."
"And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with theuniverse?!"
"(dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's goingon?"
"Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together."
"Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.."
"Uh, Joey.."
"Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.)"
"(turns off the TV) Okay.."
"Oh! That was Lambchop!"
"Please, guys, we have to talk."
"Wait, wait, I'm getting a"
"Alright, we have to talk."
"There it is!"
"Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. Imean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan."
"Is there somebody else?"
"No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change."
"We didn't change.."
"So that's it? It's over? Just like that?"
"You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care aboutsomeone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair)"
"Look, I- I could go on pretending-"
"Okay!"
"-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- Itwouldn't be fair to you!"
"Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way theywere."
"I'm sorry.."
"(sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!"
"(tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays comingup- I wanted him to meet my family-"
"I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans."
"Oh, yeah! Right!"
"Are you guys gonna be okay?"
"Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time."
"(dubious) I understand."
"Wow."
"I'm, I'm really sorry."
"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved."
"Relieved?"
"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends."
"Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun."
"Yeah. He could row like a viking."
"(entering) Hi."
"Mmm."
"So how'd it go?"
"Oh, y'know.."
"Did he mention us?"
"He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look)"
"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes herforehead.)"
"...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes."
"No no no!"
"(leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I'vegotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!"
"(shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seventhousand dollars!"
"(returns) Yeah, alright."
