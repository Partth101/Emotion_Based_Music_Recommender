"That’s not fair! I can’t do that."
"Yeah, I’m not so sure you should be here when he comes up."
"See this is what I was afraid of, I didn’t think I should be hereeither but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said he’d be over it by now."
"Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla."
"The numbers we are seeing New York, Chicago, and London areconsistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields."
"Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on andon but instead of boring you I’ll go straight to my forty two point plan."

"Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (He puts a bagwith diapers in it on the counter.)"
"Diapers huh?"
"Yep."
"So I guess Rachel had you baby?"
"Yep, can you believe it?"
"Nope!  I still can’t believe she slept with you in the firstplace."
"Huh? Ooh (laughs) you mean like a… Huh?"

"Ah actually we don’t. (Ross walks off)"
"Fine, fine okay.  But I gotta say technically, Ididn’t even do anything wrong."
"(turns back) What! (Angrily) You didn’t do anything wrong?!"
"I said I didn’t technically."
"Okay let’s put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.)"accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again)"accidentally" proposed to Rachel."
"Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this(Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I don’t really know what that means. (Ross justlooks at him) You were saying?"
"And I can even understand that you couldn’t tell Rachel, but whycouldn’t you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn’t."
"I know I should’ve. (Makes quote marks again.) "I’msorry.""
"Not using it right, Joe."

"Give me the bag."
"No, look, I don’t know what else to do. I said I’m sorry!"
"Joey!"
"You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me."
"I’m not gonna hit you."
"Why not?  You’ll feel better!  I’ll feel better, andyou know you want to. I can see it in your eyes."
"No I don’t."

"Oh my god, this really hurts!!!"
"I couldn’t help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!(He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn’t and Joey punches Ross.  Gunther is amused.)"
"What is the matter with you?!?"
"You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn’t you duck?"
"Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?"
"Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while we’re there, they cancheck your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) (Makesquote marks.) "Oops.""

"You fell asleep?"
"But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting,ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, here’s thething. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I loveTulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me gothere!"

"So?"
"So I don’t wanna be just anybody."
"Wow."
"You know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. I mean Idon’t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It’s justmuch easier if we’re just friends who have a kid."

"Rach, try holding her a different way."
"You guys, I’m doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try."
"Alright, I’ll try, fine! Yes, Okay!"
"Here you go. (Hands Emma to Phoebe)"
"Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)"
