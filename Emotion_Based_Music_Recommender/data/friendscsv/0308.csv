"Well maybe he’s just taking a nap."
"I’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning."
"All right, we should call somebody."
"And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’tmoving."
"Well, we have gotta find out if he’s alive."
"How are we gonna do that? There’s no way."
"Well, there is one way. His window’s open, I say, we poke him."
"Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get whenwe get Chinese food?"
"Yeah."
"Well, now we got a reason."
"What?"
"Well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device."
"All right."
"Hey uh, what’s a matter?"
"I talked to Janice."
"Oh my God, is she going back to him?"
"She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up thismorning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying thattwelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on thereciept!"
"What are you ah, what are you gonna do?"
"I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?"
"Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do."
"Come on, tell me."
"All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if itwas me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, Iwould bow out."
"What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joeyquickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?"
"They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like afamily, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, I know Iwouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wannaah, come poke a nude guy?"
"Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?"
"Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, nooffense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child."
"It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time,y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could."
"(confidently) I did!"
"I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time."
"I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head againstthat thing!"
"Monica did it?"
"Monica?"
"Yeah."
"Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?"
"No. Why?"
"Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabetsong, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head."
"Really?!"
"Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his leftleg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort ofy'know... (walks around in a circle)"
"Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)"
"I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell."
"(coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!(starts to chase Ross around the living room)"
"Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!"
"I’ll get the hat."
"Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let meget through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy."
"Okay."
"I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guythat breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you arethe reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matterhow nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad."
"Wow!"
"Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do."
"Oh! You’re right. Oh God. But, before I can say‘good-bye’, there’s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The wayI feel about you, it’s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie’s beensinging about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it’s like movie love, you’re mysoulmate, and I can’t believe we’re not going to be spending the rest of ourlives together."
"Then don’t leave me!"
"What?"
"Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!"
"No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I’ve got to give mymarriage another chance."
"No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorceanother chance."
"(standing up) I’m sorry. (hugs him)"
"Ohhh. Don’t go."
"No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesn’tlet her go.)"
"No. No! No! No!"
"Honey, honey, people are looking."
"I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) Idon’t care!!"
"Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now. (tries to get her leg out ofChandler’s grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe.)"
"You can’t leave! I have your shoe!"
"Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)"
"Rachel has those in burgendy."
"All right now remember, something this big and long is going to bedifficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area."
"Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!"
"I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is adead fat guy on a stick."
"All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to advancethe giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle.Okay, okay, we’re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to theirview of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread theneedle."
"He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!"
"And yet, we’re still poking him."
"Okay, retract the device, retract the device."
"He does not look happy."
"Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device."
"Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!"
