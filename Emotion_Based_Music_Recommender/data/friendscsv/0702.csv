"It starts?"
"Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans!"
"Okay! (Runs off.)"
"(incredulous) Already?!"
"Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, thecaterers, the music…"
"Oh, I got some thoughts on that."
"Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks…"
"Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to saythe right name."
"(returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3" 3-ring binder on the table.)"
"What in God’s name is that?!"
"Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forthgrade!"
"This baby has got everything. Take y’know, locations for instance.(She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, thengeographically, then by square footage."
"That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break itoff now."
"And"
"Hey! Ross!"
"Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?"
"I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monicaand Chandler."
"Oh my God! Of course, of course. (To the class.) Umm, would you pleaseexcuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’tyou… (Motions that they should learn everyone’s hometown.) (To Phoebe)Wh-what’s going on?"
"Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys justgot engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could Ijust move in with you for a couple days?"
"Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?"
"Nothing—Why?!"
"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!"
"Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like fiveminutes."
"Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?"
"(to the students) Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone wantto come to the movies?"
"All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, buttell me how this is for music."
"Okay."
"All right umm, a string quartet for the procession."
"Aw."
"A jazz trio for cocktails. The"
"Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymoreand Derrick… (Off of Rachel and Monica’s looks) And Derrick is a name Ishouldn’t know."
"(sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds upone.) Y’know, something a little snugglyer?"
"Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?"
"Well, the duck…"
"What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!"
"Uh, well he did"
"Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who areactually"
"Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!"
"Okay."
"Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?"
"Centerpieces!"
"Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)"
"Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I justthink they’re a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.)But Lilies are the clear choice."
"Oh my God! It’s like one mind."
"Uh-huh!"
"(sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You"
"Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!"
"Yes it is perfectly good, and it is"
"What?!"
"All right, I’m gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)"
"Now Joey, what did the duck do?!"
"I don’t know! But he did"
"Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does"
"Uh, Phoebe…"
"Oh Ross, hi."
"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
"I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now."
"Phoebe!"
"Okay, let’s talk outside."
"Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment!"
"What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!"
"And they knew about it?"
"(pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?"
"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever Iwant!"
"Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. Ijust don’t know what the big deal is!"
"The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartmentwhen I want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! Cold beer."
"Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?"
"Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?"
"No."
"Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?"
"Joey, did"
"Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours."
"Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?"
"Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?"
"(gasps) You found my book?!"
"Yeah I did!"
"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!"
"Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know Ishouldn’t have, but you got porn!"
"Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of mybook. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just ahealthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (Shegoes into her room.)"
"You got porn!"
"Hello."
"Hi, is uh Phoebe here?"
"Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night."
"Ohh great."
"Can I, can I help you with something?"
"Well, I don’t know. Are you a masseur?"
"(deadpan) Yes I am."
"Great! (Calls down the hall) Dad! (Her old father walks in.) Thank you somuch, I’ll be back to pick him up in an hour. (She walks away.)"
"So Chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled whenyou told them you were engaged."
"Oh yeah, I should probably call them."
"I remember when we first got engaged."
"Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story."
"Oh dad, really you don’t need to…"
"(ignoring her) Well, I’d gotten Judy pregnant. I stilldon’t know that happened."
"(incredulous) You don’t know how that happened?! Your dogthought my diaphragm was a chew toy!"
"What a sweet story."
"Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at yourfifth grade Halloween party."
"What?! They wanted a scary story!"
"Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well Iguess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.(Chandler and her laugh, but her parents don’t.) What?"
"You tell her Jack, I can’t do it."
"What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?"
"We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house."
"I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!"
"We’re sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got marriedafter you turned 30 you’d pay for it yourself."
"You bought the beach house when I was 23!"
"Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can’t puta price on that sweetie."
"We really do feel bad about this though."
"We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then thatwent to hell, so we redid the kitchen."
"What about when I started dating Chandler?"
"Well it was Chandler! We didn’t think"
"Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.(Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)"
"I can’t believe it! That there is"
"We"
"It seemed like such a simple idea."
"Stupid Jack, the word is stupid."
"All right, enough! I don’t want to hear about it anymore!(Under his breath) Good luck, Chandler. (Chandler takes another drink.)"
"Okay! Now, I’m going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh,that’s soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massagehim with those.)"
"I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help payfor it?"
"I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourthwedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has hesaves for his yearly trips to (Pause)"
"Well what happened at dinner?"
"My parents spent the money for our wedding!"
"(gasps) My God! What did you order?!"
"Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys aregonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!"
"Honey, it’s gonna be okay."
"No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swingband! No lilies!"
"No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’thave to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, youdon’t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear offthe rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)"
"Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we loveeach other and that we’re gonna get married."
"Do you even understand what off the rack means?!"
"Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself?"
"How? I don’t have any money."
"Well, I have some."
"How much?"
"Well, close to… (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides towrite it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)"
"Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!"
"Well what?! How-how much is it?!"
"It’s enough for wedding scenario eight."
"Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!"
"(To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-theamount you have is"
"(starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other."
"Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on thewedding?"
"Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and Ikinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party."
"(reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr.Chandler."
"This is the most special day of our lives."
"No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of themoney on one party."
"Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding aparty one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could"
"Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answeris no."
"You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?"
"Yes, I am!"
"Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with."
"Hey Rach."
"(quietly) Joey."
"Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?"
"Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha."
"No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s onfire."
"Well no, I don’t smell anything."
"Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins."
"(sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?"
"Nothing!"
"(takes a drink) Damn, this coffee’s cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if Iheat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)"
"Y’know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!"
"So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?"
"Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was withyou. (Exits.)"
"(chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tonsof porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) ‘Sup?"
"(entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!"
"(looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I’m sorry?"
"My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guythat worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon."
"(incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!"
"He said you poked at him with wooden spoons."
"Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give himaccu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with amop."
"Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollarsa week!"
"Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one thatdidn’t move his-his appointment."
"Oh, it’s"
"He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right, you’re right. I’msorry."
"Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?"
"His daughter was hot."
"Gotcha."
"Hey."
"Hey."
"Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to askyou to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard forthat."
"Ehh."
"Eh, you work for that."
"Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we shouldspend all of the money on the wedding."
"You do?!"
"Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I toldyou that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makesyou happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do."
"Oh, you’re so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what aboutour, what about the future and stuff?"
"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids,y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and"
"You thought about that?"
"Yeah."
"How many kids were we gonna have?"
"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
"What else did you think about?"
"Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small placeoutside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know,we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time itran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garagewhere Joey could grow old."
"(laughs) Y’know what? I-I don’t want a big, fancy wedding."
"Sure you do."
"No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage."
"You sure?"
"Uh-hmm."
"I love you so much."
"I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you weretalkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right."
"Oh yeah, totally!"
"Oh good."
"Hello, Zelda."
"Who are you supposed to be?"
"The vicar!"
"Do you even know what a vicar is?"
"Like a goalie, right?"
"(sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, it’s enough all right?! You keepmaking these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s—I’mnot—it’s just not funny anymore!"
"All right, I’m sorry. Rach I—Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’msorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)"
"All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?!Let’s do it!"
"Huh?"
"(starting to move closer to him) That’s right, I wanna do it withyou! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things."
"(nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)"
"(moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, I’ve been waitin’so long to get on that body!"
"This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)"
"Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!"
"Hey-hey, you’re startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wifethere in-in chapter seven."
"Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But,I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a"
