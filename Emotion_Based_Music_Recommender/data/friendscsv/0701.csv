"Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw…"
"(interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?"
"What?"
"See, I’ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike somepeople I’m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y’know, maybe this isselfish and I’m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be aboutthat."
"Oh honey, but it is just about…"
"It is! It is!"
"No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting backtogether!"
"What?!"
"See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!"
"Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are"
"Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!"
"Yeah!"
"That’s true."
"Honey I swear it we just kissed."
"It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)"
"You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you gettingback together?! Can I sing at your wedding?"
"Thunder being stolen!!"
"Okay come on Phoebe, it’s nothing! Monica, come on!"
"Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a"
"Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problemsin the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing thebest he can!!"
"(angrily) I don’t think that’s what they were talking aboutJoe!!"
"What a great night, Chandler can’t do it, these guys kissed…(Points to Ross and Rachel.)"
"What?"
"What?!"
"You guys kissed! Oh my—this is huge!"
"No!"
"Oh no!"
"No-no, it’s really not huge."
"And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that"
"Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we?"
"Well yeah, that and Chandler’s problem."
"Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would itmake you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel."
"Yes that would be lovely."
"You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!"
"Yes, you can pass for 19."
"Really?"
"Yes!"
"Seriously?"
"Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!"
"(gasps) I’m 30!"
"Joey, you are not! You’re 31."
"(realizes) Aww crap!"
"Okay, so"
"Y’know what? I-I think that umm, I don’t feel like going to"
"Why?!"
"Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look…"
"No-no, I-I really don’t want to talk about it! I don’t! (ToRachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)"
"Psss, that is whack!"
"(she’s strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I thinkI’ll play it at the wedding."
"Yeah! Well, I think we’ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? Imean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and thenthey just take it away like-like, "No you don’t.""
"Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away."
"Wouldn’t she?"
"Would she?"
"Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) Youate my candy bar!"
"Guess who? (Enters fully.)"
"Hey."
"Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air…"
"What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want totalk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out therekissing."
"Still thinking about it huh?"
"Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?(Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!"
"(loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?"
"I care!"
"(tightening his tie) And so do I."
"Y’know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just getchanged?"
"Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)"
"Am I"
"(sitting up) No! (Exits.)"
"I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just—it’s sotypical."
"Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There isgoing to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and"
"Paris?"
"We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something)."
"Keep talking."
"Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not justbecause it’s romantic, but because I can!"
"I love you!"
"(in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur."
"Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away."
"It’s Paris, who knows we’re here!"
"(opening the door) Hi Pheebs, what’s up? (She enters.)"
"Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna needa small deposit."
"What?!"
"Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date."
"Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!"
"Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)"
"They break your heart, don’t they?"
"Y’know, I don’t really their permission."
"Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!"
"Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you… You gotta do somethingabout your eyes."
"What?! What’s wrong with my eyes."
"They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdomin there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes."
"And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?"
"Maybe just 10 minutes for you."
"Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!"
"Yes."
"Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want totalk to anyone, especially me?"
"What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!"
"No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?"
"Well, let’s just say it’s not the first time you’vestolen my thunder."
"What?!"
"(To Rachel) Hey, here’s a thought."
"Monica, what are you talking about?"
"My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousinCharlie."
"(entering) Ahh, third base."
"It’s all everybody at the party could talk about!"
"Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because yourparty was so boring!"
"(gasps) We had a characturist!"
"Oh!!"
"(singing, angrily)"
"Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago."
"And yet, here we are doing it again."
"Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!"
"Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!"
"Got me. (He shows of his hands.)"
"All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonnahappen!"
"I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!"
"I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!"
"Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!"
"Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us gettingtogether tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off."
"(To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man."
"(ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away fromyour night?"
"I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a littleresentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’tstand the fact that your formally"
"Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what?Now I"
"(yelling after them) I can’t believe you’re gonna have sex onmy engagement night!!"
"Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)"
"Look uh, if we’re gonna do this…"
"We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna thinkthat we’re doin’ it."
"Oh, I see, so everybody wins."
"Who is it?"
"(outside the door) It’s Monica, open up!"
"Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him tofollow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)"
"Oww!"
"Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) Maywe help you?"
"I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope thatyou guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce yourengagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!"
"How is that ever going to happen?!"
"All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!"
"I know why!"
"No you"
"Okay! Why?!"
"Because! Because I was sad."
"What do you mean?"
"Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married justreminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know,maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but ohmy God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!"
"(To Ross) I don’t care, she slept with me."
"Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m"
"(starting to cry) I’m sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.(They hug.)"
"(deadpan) Well, I’m going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulationsman."
"Thanks."
"(at the door) And uh, Rachel."
"Yeah."
"What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only personwho’s going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizeswhat he said and exits disgustedly.)"
"(singing)"
"(interrupting her just in time) Hey! Here’s a dollar, consider ita deposit. Please sing at our wedding."
"Oh thank you."
"Okay. (Goes back to bed.)"
"Now… (Starts singing again) ""
