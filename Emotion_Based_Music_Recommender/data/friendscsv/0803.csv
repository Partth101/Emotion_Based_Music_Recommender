"(in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellentsecret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets."
"What secrets?"
"Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellentsecret keeper."

"Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon."
"Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having ababy. Maybe you and I should do something."
"All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitarin their apartment. Well you can let me in later."
"I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you."
"What?! They took mine to give to you!"
"Why would they take away our keys?"
"Maybe they don’t trust us."
"No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were outof town."
"You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up withMonica’s guest towels?"
"Hey, I washed those!"
"No you didn’t."

"I think I might know what this is about."
"Really?"
"Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh,about a month ago Rachel and I slept together."
"(deadpan) And?"
"Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked."
"Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!"
"Well, we-we said we’d just do it that one time but, but now I thinkshe may wanna start things up again."
"Yeah, I don’t think that’s what it is."
"Why? What-what else could it be?"
"Oh wow, I don’t feel well."
"I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. Nowonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything toyou?"
"(To Joey) Maybe it’s something you ate?"
"Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel."
"Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, y’know what I have torealize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with.Y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (Hepauses and then exits.)"

"You see, if we’d gone around them like I said, we—Shewould’ve given us those tickets. Damnit!"
"25J and K, any chance those aren’t together?"
"I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours."
"Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon asthey’re done with it at the key shining place."
"What the hell is that?"
"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?"
"You said there was a gas leak in here."
"Well why don’t you use your key?"
"Because by the time I find it on this thing (Holds up a huge keyring with a thousand keys on it), the whole place might have exploded. If that happens atanother building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. (To the fireman)Come on! Hurry up."
"Oh! We could have done that."

"(quietly confident) I think we do. Why don’t we go inside? (They goinside.) Look uh, I know why you’re here."
"You do?"
"Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I shouldtalk first."
"(warily) Okay."
"Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross.That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it?"
"(confused) What?"
"I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainlypassionate, but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends?"
"Seriously. What?!"
"Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time.I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now."
"Okay, y’know what? Can I, can I talk now?"

"Yeah, I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—Idon’t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom."
"I know. I know, but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time."
"What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!"
"They do!"
"No they don’t!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns withhis box of condoms.) Well they should put it in"
"Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms."
"Oh well I may as well have!"
"Listen, y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I foundout…"
"Freaked out? Hey no, I’m not freaked out! I’m"
"Y’know what? Let’s, let’s talk later."

"Well I’m gonna have to put on a new lock, they’ll findout anyway."
"Oh no."
"(measures the top of the doorframe) Whoa! This looks like an allday job, I’ll have to cancel my yoga class. (Ross walks up.) Hey Ross!"

"Sure."

"Didn’t you two already talk?"
"Yeah but uh… Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slepttogether, but there’s something else. (Pause) Rachel’s pregnant."
"(simultaneously) Oh my God!!! I can’t believe that!!"
"(simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!"
"With my child."
"That is brand new information!!"
"You already know don’t you?"
"A little bit."
"How are you doing?"
"Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think Ihandled it very well."
"Well, what did you say to her?"
"Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.And then when I turned around she was gone."
"Oh Ross."
"But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97%effective."
"(shocked) What?"
"I gotta go find her."
"Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time theydon’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!"
"Evidently they do."
"What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)"
"I can’t believe we’re here."
"Oh you’ve got to be kidding me."
"What? (Monica sees the first couple and gasps.)"
"As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you thehoneymoon suite."
"No!! You have been screwing us all day!"
"Who are you?"
"We’re you just ten seconds later!"
"Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! Imean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!"
"Well you can have the suite if you want. We don’t care about wherewe stay. We’re here to celebrate our love together. We don’t have to get freestuff. We just want to be together."
"(looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff."
"Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’from your apartment."
"What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!"
"What else is new?"
"Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys."
"Well do something! Get in there!"
"How? I guess I could break down your door."
"Yeah! Do that!"
"And-and you won’t blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbsup.)"
"No! (Pause) Are you doing it?! I don’t hear anything! Come on!"
"Uh, okay I’ll-I’ll-I’ll break it down. (He hands the phoneto Phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)"
"Oh hey hi, he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door. (Thechair breaks in half.) Okay, we’re in. (She hangs up the phone.)"
"Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?"
"(sighs) If I said I was, would you judge me?"
"The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram."
"Okay. (The nurse exits.) Oh man, I swear if they sold these at"
"Hi!"
"(shocked) Hi!"
"Uh we-we need to talk."
"Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I’ve kinda got an el fresco situationgoing on over here."
"Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today."
"Okay Ross that’s fine, but can you please stand near my head?"
"What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) I’m sorry. I mean I-Ithink I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towardsRachel’s feet) really—I should have been thinking about you Rach…"
"Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!"
"Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to bethere through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments, the uh, theLamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry aboutthat ‘til after we get married."
"What married?"
"Well yeah, I think we should get married."
"What, because that’s your answer to everything?"
"No, because that’s the right thing to do."
"Yeah, maybe if you’re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, arewe?"
"No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone."
"Excuse me?"
"Come on Rach, you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant."
"What?!"
"I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expectto have a baby by yourself?"
"I can too eat by myself!"
"When have you ever?"
"When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!"
"Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!"
"Oh please, you inhale your food!"
"I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!!"
"(entering) Am I interrupting?"
"Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father."
"But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone."
"Huh. Nice to meet you. I’ll get started on this."
"(To Rachel, standing by her feet) I don’t know why you can’tadmit that you need me."
"I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!"
"Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. (We see Rossand Rachel looking at the screen.) Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby."
"Oh my God."
"Wow. There it is, I see it."
"Congratulations. I’ll give you two a minute."
"Okay."
"Thank you."
"Pretty amazing huh?"
"I don’t see it!"
"What? What?!"
"I can’t see it!"
"You-you just said that you did!"
"I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother!I can’t even see my own baby!"
"Oh sure, come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,(rolls the machine closer) it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there (Points)."
"Oh. Oh, it’s beautiful. I see it now."
"Do you really?"
"No, I don’t see it!"
"Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? (Points) This tiny thingthat looks like a peanut?"
"Yeah."
"Sweetie that’s it."
"That’s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you."
"You’re welcome."
"Wow! I can’t believe that’s our baby."
"Yeah, that’s our baby."
"Hi."
"Hey!"
"Hey! So how was the doctor?"
"Oh, everything went great."
"Good."
"Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus."
"Oh."
"I don’t see the baby. Where is it?"
"Oh no, I know I couldn’t see it either at first, but it’sright umm… (Starts to cry) Ross, I lost it again."
"Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her."
