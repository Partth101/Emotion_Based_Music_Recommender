"Nice shot."
"I got it!!"
"Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)"
"I can't believe you let them win!"
"Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashedracquet from his bag.)"

"My turn? What-what are you talking about?"
"Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler."
"What?!"
"I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll justtell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said,"Laundry? Is"
"Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let meknow how that one turns out."

"What?!"
"Are you serious?!"
"Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening tome. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) Itis amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention."
"You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We…"
"And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!"
"(turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just anold Wonton!"
"Judge rules, Nutter-Butter."
"Ohh, tough call."
"Yeah."
"But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And herhusband Bill. (Chandler does the laugh.)"
"So how do you kids like your coffee?"
"Oh, none for me. Thanks."
"Just a little bit of sugar."
"Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughtasweeten it up, huh? (Once again, with the laugh.)"
"(To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?"
"Oh, you get used to it."
"Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will beit for me on the work things."
"So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?"
"I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging outwith my boyfriend who I actually respect."
"Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)"
"(entering) Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for itif it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. (Chandler does notlaugh.) Did you hear what I said Bing?"
"What?"
"The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?"
"Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir."
"Excuse me?"
"Well, I just…"
"(interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke."
"Really?"
"Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You seeKara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it wasweak physically. You get it now honey?"
"I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica."
"I thought you could use the help."
"Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)"
"(entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?"
"Sure! Why?"
"Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate."
"What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keepslying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them rightnow!"
"(from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racistjokes now?!"
"Sorry! I'm just—I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hatehaving to lie to Rachel!"
"But we're not ready to tell yet!"
"I know! It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person Itold everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend."
"(entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!"
"Hey! Hi!"
"Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover thefact that she's wearing men's boxers.]"
"Well, I was actually—I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm,look at my books, y'know, see them a little better."
"Okay great!"
"Yeah!"
"Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I wascleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!"
"Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money."
"Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work."
"That's good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at mybooks!"
"Okay."
"Okay."
"I'll get back to my new job."

"Man, she is really gullible."
"Here you go. (Serves them both some coffee.)"
"Thanks!"
"Actually, I should get going."
"Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm onsabbatical from work, right?"
"Yes! Yes! You did!"
"Oh…"
"What is wrong now?!"
"This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First mymarriage falls apart and then…"

"I am now."
"Okay."
"Umm, hi."
"Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey. (Laughs and exits.)"
"Dude, we got to talk."
"Okay."
"I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and Ihope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his reallaugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?"
"Why would I be mad?"
"Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don'tuh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends orgirls they're related to."
"(realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But youknow what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! Theyforgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well,but I want you to remember that"
"Okay."
"I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!"
"All right."
"And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) sevendollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write itdown—let's write it down!"
