"Why, what happened?"
"Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well,that’s not the worst part."
"What is the worse part?"

"I mean, was it Gina?"
"Which one is Gina?"
"Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings."
"No, no, no, that’s Dina."
"(to Monica) You see you can’t tell which one is which either,dwha!!"
"We didn’t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!"
"Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the redskirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat."
"That was me."
"Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overlyfriendly, and I’m sorry."
"That’s okay."
"That’s all right."
"That’s okay."
"(angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!"
"Hey, Joey."
"Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)"
"Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)"
"Why can’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses."
"I just got off the phone with my sister."
"Ah, which, which one?"
"Mary-Angela."
"Mary-Angela."
"Yeah."
"Y'know which one was she again?"
"Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooledaround with her. She told me you said you could really"

"I am good. I finished my book."
"Oh yeah, what’s it about?"
"I don’t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?"
"Yeah, I do. (they both run out)"
"Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letterI’ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell’s a matter with you? How doyou think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with aletter?"
"Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France.When actually I’ll be in Cuba."
"All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay inperson. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela,okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let herdown easy."
"What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?"
"Where in Cuba?"
"(shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doinghere?"
"Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?"
"I’m here to see Mary-Angela."
"You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look,listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you twoyet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit onMussolini's hanging body. Yeah."
"Where’s Mary-Angela?"
"She’s right in there. (motions to the living room)"
"Hey, Chandler!"
"I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, andhe didn’t call."
"Bummer."
"(to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy."
"No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look,Rach, I want only good things for you."
"Wait a minute, why don’t you just call Mark. (they both look up inshock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to makestuff happen."
"But, you, you don’t want to seem too pushy."
"(to Ross) Honey, it’s not pushy, he gave her his home number."
"(to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? Asin like, to, to his home?"
"Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want goodthings for me."
"That’s right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances atMonica)"

"Yay!"
"There you go."
"He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it."
"Oh, that is amazing!"
"Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I’d expect nothing less."
"I got to figure out what I’m going to wear."
"High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro."
"Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woohoo!"
"You go get ‘em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you insome way?"

"Are you crazy?!"
"Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guyis taking my girlfriend out for a meal."
"What?! Ross y'know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is aboutRachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’reright, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?"
"No."
"I mean don’t you trust her?"
"Well, yeah!"
"Then get over yourself! Grow up!"
"(shyly) You grow up."
"This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?"
"No! I did!"
"Well, it’s, it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?"
"Of course! It’s her favorite."
"So um, Mary-Angela, what’s your second favorite?"
"More of Grandma’s teramisu."
"Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this isgreat. It’s top notch."
"That dies with me."
"So will I."
"Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom."
"Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything."
"(whispering in his ear) Just do it."
"Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)"
"(startled) Hey!"
"Finally, I thought we’d never be alone. Can I just tellyou something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. (kisses him)"
"Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but heducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really ina, in a commitment kind of place."
"So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have thesoftest lips."
"Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela."
"No, I’m Mary-Theresa."
"This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?"
"(standing behind Chandler) I am!"
"Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn’t see Mary-Angela)"
"Joey!!!"
"No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!"
"What’s goin’ on?"
"(pats him on the shoulder) You’re it! Now run and hide!"
"It’s no big deal. Chandler was just kissin’ me becausehe thought I was Mary-Angela."
"What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?"
"I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey’ssisters gasp) Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look reallysimilar."
"I say, punch him Joey."
"Yeah! Punch him!!"
"Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s notgoing to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?"
"Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’dbe on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!"
"Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just wantyou to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my bestfriend. I would never do anything like this ever again."
"So what. I say, punch him."
"Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!"
"No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler."
"I’ll do it."
"No you won’t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believehim, he’s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you’ve got one more apology to make, allright, you’ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela."
"Okay, absolutely!"
"All right."
"You’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but hestill doesn’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)"
"Cookie, now you can punch him!"
"What?! (Cookie punches him)"
"(getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!"
"Hi!"
"What are you doing here?"
"Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)"
"Oh."
"Hi. (kisses her)"
"Hi."
"How’d did it go?"
"Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thankGod Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happyand wouldn’t shut up."
"I’m so proud of you."
"Me too!"
"Listen, I’m ah, I’m sorry I’ve been so crazy and jealousand, it’s just that I like you a lot, so..."

"Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down."
"Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he reallyhappens to like me."
"Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?"
"Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?"
"All right, that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guyis going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel)But, is he a big guy?"
