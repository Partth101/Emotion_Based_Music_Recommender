"Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. Imean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishingnext week?"

"What’s Phase Two?"
"Gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club."

"I can’t! I have to work!"
"Phoebe?"
"I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening."

"No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!"
"You want me to take some girl I’ve never met to the opera so you cango to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie."
"(looking out the peephole) Ohh, she’s looking down the hall. Oh!She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can’t see people through that little hole, canyou? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!"
"Hello! (Monica screams)"
"I’ll be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! Ithought we have moved on! I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happyfor each other! I mean was that just me?"
"All right, I’ll do it."
"Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.)Emily?"
"Yes."
"I’m Rachel Green."
"Thank goodness."
"There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out thatI’m not free tonight. So…"
"Really?! Well, that’s just lovely, isn’t it? I must’vemissed your call, even though I didn’t leave the flat all day."
"Oh well, no I…"
"Oh, no-no-no, that’s not rude! It’s perfectly in keeping with atrip that I’ve already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and beenstrip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someonewho’s got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum."
"I-I-I think you look great."
"Good night, it was very nice to meet you all. (Storms out.)"
"I’ll get her."
"Please hurry."
"Don’t you just"
"Ohh!"
"What?"
"It kicked! I think the baby kicked!"
"Oh my God!"
"Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted."
"(running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be onthe set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!"
"Oh wait, Joey, you can’t go like that! You stink!"
"Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t havetime! They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it."
"Yeah. Run ten blocks, that’ll help the smell."
"Hey—whoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joeyruns off.) Wow!"
"So? How did it go with Joshua last night?"
"Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night,"
"What?"
"Why?"
"The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I gotthere, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep."
"Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?"
"No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us andshe was all, "I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!" and he let herright in."
"So you hit her in the face?"
"No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to stealmy umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a fewhours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me."
"(going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs."
"Honey, that’s you’re name."
"That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we calledeach other!"
"Hey! You’re wearing pants!"
"That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk andsee some strippers."
"It’s 9:30 in the morning!"

"Oh-oh, my God!"
"Well, can I just…"

"What? Who the hell is Emily—(realises) noooo!!"
"They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her armsfranticly and hits Chandler.)"
"Ow!"
"How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hitsChandler again.)"
"Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time."
"When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Whowouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes,she was a totally different person."
"(rushing in) Ross! Come quickly! There’s a deer just outside eatingfruit from the orchard!"
"I’ve gotta go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from theorchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)"
"He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from theorchard."
"I don’t get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)"
"Okay, I’m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves intothe living room.)"
"Why do you care so much anyway?"
"I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset thatI’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meetsomeone and go flitting off to Vermont!"
"Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail."

"So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?"
"A couple of days."
"Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen. (Hestarts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)"
"What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!"
"Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go backin time."
"Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your PhaseTwo strip club thing with us."
"Yeah, come on, we can be guys!"
"(laughs) No you can’t."
"Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!"
"You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy andwouldn’t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)"
"Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off andyou come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!"
"Okay. (Starts to cry)"
"I’m sorry. (Goes and hugs him)"
"(rushing in) Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I’m here! I’m here!"
"Calm down, we got time, we’re running a little late."
"Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!"
"Yeah, we loves ‘em. I’ve never seen him with—(He gets awhiff of Joey and starts smelling around.)"
"(trying to act like he’s not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, whatthe hell is that? What smells so bad?"
"You."
"Y’know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know whoI think it is?"
"You?"
"No-no, it’s uh, it’s Heston."
"What?"
"Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip andthen ate some liquorice."
"There’s no way he smells, he’s the only one around here witha shower in his dressing room."
"Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?"
"The one with "Heston" on it."
"Interesting."
"(coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, I’vegot some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?"
"No thanks, Mom!"
"Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, ‘causeI’m pregnant."
"Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (He leaves.)"
"Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancer’s hotpants) so good."
"(doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic."
"(joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’tcall. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club.Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!"
"Come on! Look where you are!!"
"(to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris."
"Remember, a virgin for me please."
"Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpetguy."
"Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’mjust gonna go home and call Kathy."
"Well, if you think it will help."
"No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get reallydrunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that,I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice"
"You should! How is she?"
"Ohhh!!"
"I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)"
"Hello! Who’s in there? (He opens to curtain to reveal anaked and wet Joey.)"
"How ya doin’?"
"Who in the hell are you?"
"I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?"
"Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt."

"Joey, right?"
"Yeah."
"(tosses him a towel, motions for him to get out of the showerand sits down on the couch) Every actor at one time or another—opp! (Joey tries tosit down next to him and Heston makes him sit somewhere else.) Every actor thinks hestinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won’t evenwatch himself."
"Oh no-no-no, you don’t understand…"
"Listen to me!"
"Oh yeah, yeah."
"I don’t know one actor worth his salt that didn’t sayat one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there,first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matterhow badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room anduse my shower! Do you understand me?!"
"Yes sir! Yes sir, I’m-I’m—(he starts to leave)"
"Wait a minute! Take your pants."

"Yeah, come on! What’s going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)"
"Yeah. And y’know, if you wanna cry, that’s okay too."
"Okay, look, I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave."
"Come on! Chandler!"
"Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay?Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them.(Sits back in disgust.)"
"They really were pretty, weren’t they? (Rachel and Phoebe bothagree)"
"Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one."
"Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!"
"Yeah."
"Y’know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler isintrigued.) It’d, it’d be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was sopetite."
"See, I don’t know, for me it would have to Chantal."

"(jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!"
"Really?!"
"I am totally picturing you with all those women!"
"That’s-that’s not Phase Three."
"Well, I’m there too!"
"Well, are we all together? Like in a group?"
