"(reminiscing) Ah, finally an explanation."
"No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again. (To Ross) I really preferdoing that at the home office y’know? (Ross nods his head.) Ooh-ooh, maybe they wantlike some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?"

"Yeah?"
"What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you’reworking?"
"Uhh do it?"
"That guy (points) has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes!He’s complained about you three times! (He hands the coffee cup to Joey, assumingthat Joey will deliver it and walks away.)"
"Well, where was I? (Takes a sip of the coffee.)"
"Hi!"
"Hey!"
"Hey, what have you guys been up to?"
"Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!"
"Wow!"
"Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!"
"Takes it out of you? (Laughs.)"
"Now, we can kick anybody’s ass!"
"Yeah!"
"After one class? I don’t think so."
"What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) andpretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!"
"Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming,that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s aconcept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call (he holds twofingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi."
"Isn’t that a kind of sushi?"
"No, it’s a concept!"
"Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!"
"All right, maybe it means that too…"
"Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!"
"Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!"
"(deadpan) Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is."
"Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagican you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!"
"You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat oryour kettle of fish?"
"(moves closer) All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being preparedfor an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, Idon’t know, like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachel’s and screams)"
"All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean youhave unagi. (Does the finger thing.)"
"(To Phoebe) Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we couldhave unagi in about a half-hour."
"Y’know what… (Moves away as Chandler enters, panicked.)"
"Hey-hey, is Monica here?"
"No."
"No."
"Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her forValentine’s Day."
"Well, Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn’tget her a calendar!"
"(laughs) She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’recelebrating it tonight."
"Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of thoseromantic spas?"
"Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea!"
"And of course, crotchless panties."
"Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and herbrother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) Ican’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year."
"Aw, I love that."
"You guys!"
"You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair ofscissors and you just cut…"
"(interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds likeso much fun."
"Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut."
"Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?"
"I made a… (Does one of those gibberish words.)"
"What is that?"
"Nothing!"
"So what are you gonna do?"
"Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?"
"Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (Shetakes out a sock that’s been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, andtwo other socks sown onto it for ears.) Oh for crying out loud!"
"Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!"
"Now, it’s you little bunny friend. (She sticks it in Rachel’sface and they both laugh.)"
"(admiring his work) This, this actually is a… (Does the samegibberish word from before.)"
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Daygifts?"
"Oh, yeah."
"Do we have to make the entire thing?"
"Yes! Why, did you—you forget to make yours?"
"Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the placewhere I-I made it and pick-pick it up."
"Okay. (They kiss.) Okay, I can’t wait! This is going to be the bestValentine’s Day ever! (Chandler giggles and exits.) I can’t believe it! Make thepresents! Make the presents!"
"(sticking his head back in) What?"
"I’m just so excited to make the presents! (Chandler does anothersarcastic/scared laugh and leaves.) Shoot!"
"(to the receptionist) Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all dorespect I’d like to donate some fluids."
"We’re actually at the end of one of our research cycles, sowe’re not looking for applicants right now."
"Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up. (She just looks athim in horror.) Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?"
"Well, here’s a schedule of what’s coming up. (Hands itto him.)"
"Thanks. (Starts to read it.) Well but this one starts now. (Points toone.)"
"Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins areeligible. It’s a twins study."
"But it’s $2,000."
"Sorry."
"Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani onattractive nurse receptionists."
"We already got the results back on that on, and they’re notgood. (Joey beats a hasty retreat.)"
""
"Ross!!!"
"What the hell was that?!"
"A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thingevery time now.)"
"Ohh,"
"Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screamswould you have begun to"
"All right, so we weren’t"
"I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, butI—look, I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbageand Ross screams…)"
"(in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin.Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot toreveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then backat his script.)"
"Hey."
"(not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you."
"What?!"
"Unagi. I’m always aware."
"Okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?"
"What’s up?"
"I can’t figure out what to make Monica."
"Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes."
"I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here thatlooks homemade?"
"Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this. (Picks up a model ofthe Saturn V rocket, that’s the one that took man to the moon.) Uh, it’s anexact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade."
"Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me tothe moon."
"Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. Butyou-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and returnsafely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read theChristmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took thefamous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)"
"Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her."
"Why not?"
"Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hateMonica" on the bottom."
"Oh."
"DANGER"
"Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)"
"Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way,and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Thenhe holds it out as if he’s giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throwsit down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out apair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties hejust removed.) I can’t do it. I can’t do it. (He throws them both down andcontinues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! Amixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)"
"Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?"
"Sure! Okay, you go first."
"Okay, come here! Come here."
"Okay! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on thecouch.)"
"Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it."
"Okay."
"But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs."
"Oh, what a great gift! Is"
"(momentarily terrified) Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!"
"Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!"
"Okay!"
"Okay, you ready to open yours?"
"Yeah!"
"Okay."
"It’s a sock bunny."
"Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?"
"Not really."
"Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. Seethat’s what this is about."
"I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies."
"No! No, she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes—that’suh—they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different—Okay! Okay! Okay! Ididn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact thatwe’re supposed to"

"Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.)"
"Oops! (Covers its eyes.) Y’know, your birthday is in amonth-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?"
"You are totally and completely 100% forgiven."
"We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.)"

"Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought wastoo expensive?"
"You have done enough!"
"I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!"
"No you don’t—get it in black, not brown."
"Oop, your cake is ready!"
"Oop!"
"Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake."
"Hey Mon! Hey Chann! (He goes to the fridge) Justgettin’ a soda! (Does so.)"
"Who the hell are you?!"
"I’m Joey! How are you doin’?!"
"(entering) No! No! No! No! No! How"
"Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl."
"Who the hell is Carl?!"
"Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for amedical research project."
"Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you,aren’t they?"
"Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? Theonly problem is, Carl’s acting is… (Does the international hand symbol forso-so.)"

"That’s us."
"(seeing they’re not identical) But uh, this is a study foridentical twins."

"But, you’re not identical twins."
"Damnit Carl!"
