You thought about that?,"Confidence, Surprise, Excitement"
Yeah.,Neutral
How many kids were we gonna have?,"Happiness, Contentment, Love"
"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.","Happiness, Contentment, Excitement"
What else did you think about?,"Anticipation, Confusion, Frustration"
"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.","Happiness, Contentment, Love"
"(laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.","Happiness, Contentment, Confidence"
Sure you do.,Confidence
"No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.",Unknown
