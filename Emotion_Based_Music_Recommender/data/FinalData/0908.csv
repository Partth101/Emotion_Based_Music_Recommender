Thats a great movie. <she claps>,"Happiness, Excitement, Optimism"

Well who would?,"Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"

"I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die  and I don't get your baby?","Neutral, Sadness, Frustration"
"See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.  We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected  to the baby.","Neutral, Sadness, Frustration"
Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's  a lump.,"Neutral, Disgust, Confusion"
"You know, guys I got to say. This means so much  to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica  and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts  about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts  to cry>","Sadness, Love"

Monica is Ross' sister.,"Happiness, Contentment, Love"
"No, Ross' sister was really fat.","Neutral, Disgust, Frustration"
That was me.,"Contentment, Confidence, Neutral"
"No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that  used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.","Neutral, Disgust, Nostalgia"
Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.,"Confusion, Frustration"
"Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets  face it you have fun.","Happiness, Contentment, Excitement"
"Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate  lady dies, then do I get the baby?","Anger, Frustration, Optimism"
"No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated  at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?","Confusion, Frustration, Optimism"
Well actually...,"Confidence, Excitement, Optimism"
Actually what?,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"
"well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma  would go to my parents.","Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
What?,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"
"Hurts, doesn't it?","Sadness, Anger, Frustration"
"So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough  to raise Emma?",Sadness
Yeah he's lying. He looked down.,"Confidence, Neutral, Frustration"
Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent?  Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!,"Anger, Confusion, Frustration"
"Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think  you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.","Contentment, Confidence, Love"
Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like  Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.,"Confidence, Excitement, Optimism"
"Thats not how you see me, is it?","Sadness, Disgust, Frustration"
"Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do  you really think I'm not capable?","Confidence, Frustration, Optimism"
"No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're  strongest when.. when you're together.","Contentment, Love, Optimism"
Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks  on table>  she'd have to give her up.,"Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
"Sure, Monica would have to give her up.","Neutral, Sadness"
"I lie better then that, right?","Confidence, Excitement, Optimism"
"So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends  die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left  in my life gets taken away from me?","Sadness, Anger, Frustration"
There's your movie! <claps>,"Happiness, Confidence, Excitement"
Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.,"Neutral, Surprise, Longing"
Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise  poorly?,"Confidence, Surprise, Disgust"
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about.  I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of  Merlot and a five year old condom.,"Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
"Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong  father figure and I never will be.","Sadness, Frustration"
No you learn these things. You grow into it.,"Confidence, Neutral, Frustration"
"Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said  was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody  knows it.","Sadness, Fear, Frustration"
I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because  I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard  parts.,"Confidence, Love, Excitement"
"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying Go  to your room! You're grounded""?""","Confidence, Anger, Frustration"
"Can you hear me say You're grounded""?""","Anger, Confusion, Frustration"
You said that to me last week.,"Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.,Frustration
It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's  easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the  parade because you had a family emergency.,"Neutral, Confusion, Optimism"
"Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because  I had a family emergency.","Neutral, Sadness, Frustration"
"Ooh, what happened?","Surprise, Excitement, Anticipation"
No! Nothing with a raccoon.,"Neutral, Disgust, Frustration"
"Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands  out in the air>","Anger, Frustration"
Oh wait.. What are you doing?,"Surprise, Confusion"
Setting the table.,"Contentment, Neutral, Frustration"
Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy  china for dessert too.,"Contentment, Excitement, Anticipation"
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses  on my wedding dress.,"Happiness, Disgust, Excitement"
"Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.",Neutral
"Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't  know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I  want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.","Sadness, Anger, Frustration"
"Ucch.  <pauses> Uchh <louder  this time> In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.","Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>,"Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.,"Confidence, Neutral, Frustration"
Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when  I died and didn't give you my baby?,"Nostalgia, Confusion, Frustration"
"This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I  mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.","Sadness, Longing, Optimism"
What? What carrer?,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"
Um.. I'm a decorator.,"Contentment, Confidence, Neutral"
Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a  decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.,Confidence
Why can't you ever be supportive?,"Anger, Frustration"
Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even  come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.,"Sadness, Anger, Frustration"
Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in  the hospital when I was getting my lips done.,"Sadness, Disgust, Frustration"
I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks  into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving  Emily to you.,"Anger, Confusion, Frustration"
Emma.,"Confidence, Excitement, Anticipation"
Oh whose side are you on? <back  to Amy> I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle  the responibility of a child.,"Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
How hard could it be? You do it.,"Confidence, Anticipation, Frustration"
ooh oooh..,"Happiness, Excitement, Anticipation"
Do you want to know why you don't want  me to have  the baby?,"Anger, Confusion, Frustration"
uh huh.,"Neutral, Frustration"
Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have  always been jealous of me.,"Anger, Frustration"
"Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You,  your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?","Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
"Uh.. To name a few.  You know.. You know.. You've  just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't  have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do  you even realize how much that hurt me?","Sadness, Anger, Frustration"
Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!,"Sadness, Anger, Disgust"
"Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.","Neutral, Disgust, Frustration"
"I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here  today.","Anger, Surprise, Disgust"
"Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called  sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.",Frustration
ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's  forty five.,"Confidence, Excitement"
"You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your  new baby and your, your small apartment. <directs this to Ross who in turns  throws the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something.  Your baby isn't even that cute.","Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
You take that back.,"Anger, Frustration"
No.,"Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
Take it back!,"Anger, Frustration, Longing"
No! What are you going to do? Make me?,"Anger, Frustration"
"Heey man, I work out.","Confidence, Excitement, Optimism"

"Uh, yeah I think I did.","Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>,"Anger, Surprise, Frustration"
Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't  time!,Frustration
Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?,"Fear, Surprise"
What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello  on them.,"Anger, Surprise, Excitement"
Ew! Gross.,"Surprise, Disgust"
"Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and  you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't  be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones  I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize  to her right now.","Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
I'm sorry.,"Neutral, Sadness"
"Mon, I'm so sorry.",Sadness
Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize  to each other and mean it.,"Happiness, Confidence, Frustration"
"By the way, that fight was totally arousing.","Surprise, Excitement, Confusion"
"Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel  dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.","Contentment, Confidence, Love"
Oh yeah? Well thanks.,"Happiness, Contentment, Confidence"
"So, so now do I get Joey?","Excitement, Anticipation, Longing"
"Okay, but you should know he eats five times a  day and shoves pennies up his nose.","Neutral, Surprise, Disgust"
Are you okay Mon?,"Neutral, Love"
uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a  plate. Its not like somebody died.,"Neutral, Disgust, Frustration"
It's all right. You can mourn.,Sadness
"Actually its not pies, its just pie.","Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my  god. I've lost the will to scold.,"Neutral, Surprise, Frustration"
"Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm  sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..",Sadness
So you're going to give me the baby?,"Neutral, Surprise, Confusion"

She needs changing.,"Contentment, Confidence, Neutral"
"Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent  and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there  Emma.

Like only if the queen comes?,"Excitement, Anticipation, Optimism"
Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in),"Surprise, Anticipation, Confusion"
