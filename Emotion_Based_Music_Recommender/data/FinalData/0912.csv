"Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who   I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on   the plate of cookies.",Contentment
"You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary,   and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.","Anger, Fear, Disgust"

For what?,"Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
"Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous   and arrogant and obnoxious ...","Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
Is this your first appology?,"Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
"No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And   I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.",Unknown
Good morning!,"Happiness, Contentment, Optimism"
"Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf,   I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry,   obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait   'till it's finished.","Happiness, Disgust, Frustration"
What?,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"
I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!,"Anger, Disgust, Frustration"

"Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.","Sadness, Anger, Disgust"
Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?,"Anger, Frustration"
"Oh yeah, I'm jealous. Oh Gavin","Frustration, Longing"
I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.,"Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
"That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know   that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had   a deap meaningful relationship.","Confidence, Frustration"
Huh. What's Tag's last name?,"Neutral, Anticipation, Confusion"
"It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last   name. It was just Tag"". You know","Surprise, Excitement, Confusion"

"Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely   right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name   was Morgan! Huh!","Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
It was Jones.,"Confidence, Neutral"
"Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?","Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
"Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.","Happiness, Contentment, Love"
"You mean, when you were a baby.","Neutral, Nostalgia, Confusion"
Sure.,"Contentment, Confidence, Neutral"
Would you stop staring at her?,"Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
I wasn't staring. I was leering.,"Disgust, Confusion, Frustration"
What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind   of way.,"Neutral, Disgust, Confusion"
"Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there   in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me   feel like I earned it.","Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.,"Happiness, Contentment, Confidence"
"Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl   for once.","Happiness, Contentment, Love"

I think it's sweet. (goes to leave),"Happiness, Contentment, Love"
"Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.","Happiness, Love"
"(to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if   you didn't go after her.","Neutral, Frustration"
Why not?,"Confidence, Excitement, Optimism"
"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything   to, you know, drive her away.","Confidence, Fear, Optimism"
"So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call   her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds   about right.","Confidence, Neutral, Frustration"
"Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just   forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.","Neutral, Frustration, Longing"
"Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told   me I can't have it makes me want her even more!","Anger, Frustration, Longing"
"What are you, a child?","Confidence, Anger, Frustration"
Yes!,"Happiness, Excitement, Optimism"
"Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy   on someone else.","Sadness, Disgust, Frustration"
"Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)","Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
(to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave),"Happiness, Excitement, Anticipation"

"Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.","Confidence, Neutral, Frustration"

"I don't know, I mean I'm not sure (they hear cracking voice from   somewhere else in the kitchen, probably a rat caught in a trap) ...","Neutral, Fear, Confusion"
"Oh my god, we killed Bob!","Sadness, Fear, Surprise"
"Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.","Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"

Whazzup??,"Happiness, Confidence, Excitement"
"Seriously dude, 3 years ago.","Neutral, Nostalgia, Frustration"
"Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep   an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?","Confidence, Neutral"
You don't trust him?,Neutral
"Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked   for her daughter, the hot nanny"".""","Disgust, Confusion, Frustration"
"Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?   Because I could get a job any day now.","Confusion, Frustration, Optimism"
"You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm   sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do   this for me?","Confidence, Frustration, Optimism"
"Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know   as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not,   he's going to have sex with it.","Confidence, Anticipation, Frustration"
"Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. (pause)",Frustration
Picturing that tree?,"Contentment, Nostalgia, Longing"
"I am, yes.","Contentment, Confidence, Neutral"
"Where you going, Joe?","Anticipation, Confusion"
For a walk.,"Contentment, Neutral, Excitement"

"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize   my thoughts.","Neutral, Frustration, Longing"
Your thoughts? Plural?,"Confidence, Confusion, Frustration"
"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta   see her!","Happiness, Excitement, Anticipation"
"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.","Confidence, Fear, Frustration"
"Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me!   She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable   boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over   there?","Anger, Confusion, Frustration"
"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.","Confidence, Neutral, Frustration"

Does he?,Neutral
What?,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"

"What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?","Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
"No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair.   What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?   Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,   and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this   way about anyone since Rachel, ok?

(starts counting with her fingers)   That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?","Fear, Confusion, Frustration"
"Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let   the box of rats ruin our lives.","Neutral, Fear, Frustration"
"Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away.   But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's   favorites.","Contentment, Confidence, Love"
It's gonna be ok.,"Confidence, Optimism"
You must think I'm crazy.,"Sadness, Confusion, Frustration"
"No, I think you're sweet.","Happiness, Contentment, Love"
