"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.","Confidence, Neutral, Frustration"

What do you mean?,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"
"I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have ourown zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping.

What equity investments?,"Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
"The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes hisforehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But Ifigured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start tothink that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right?

But it’s my car!,"Anger, Frustration"
"Yeah, but it’s my wax.","Confidence, Frustration"

"Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!","Fear, Surprise"
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!,"Fear, Surprise, Excitement"
"No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, lookat his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.","Fear, Disgust, Frustration"
"They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way overprotective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!","Confidence, Surprise, Frustration"
What?!,Surprise
"Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to checkon the babies again.)","Neutral, Disgust, Frustration"
"Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.","Happiness, Contentment, Love"
Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being ableto put both legs over your head.,Happiness
"Oh, I can still do that.","Contentment, Confidence, Optimism"
How are you still single?!,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"
(entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybeyou’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.,"Confidence, Confusion, Frustration"
Good. What made you change your mind?,"Confidence, Surprise, Anticipation"
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.,"Surprise, Excitement, Confusion"
How did that happen?!!,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"
"Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And itturns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying tocough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)","Sadness, Confusion, Frustration"
"Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watchingthe babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! (He does it again.)","Anger, Surprise, Frustration"
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,"Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.","Contentment, Confidence, Neutral"
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the groundsthat Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,"Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
"Fine, I’m mentally unstable.","Sadness, Confusion, Frustration"
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,"Neutral, Disgust, Confusion"
What?!,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"
"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",Disgust
Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!,"Disgust, Confusion, Frustration"
"Well, you would know.","Confidence, Neutral, Frustration"
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference beforemarriage?,"Surprise, Disgust, Frustration"
"Oh, come on!","Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
"(starts to cry) Ross, please, I found the magazines!","Sadness, Fear, Frustration"
"And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, thatmakes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin.","Sadness, Anger, Disgust"
"Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin,I’m not gay, and there is","Anger, Confusion, Frustration"
That won’t be necessary.,"Confidence, Neutral, Frustration"
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!,"Happiness, Love, Excitement"
Ugh!,"Sadness, Disgust, Frustration"
"Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that reallycreates a problem.","Neutral, Sadness, Frustration"
"Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!(To the stenographer) And could you strike Consummated like bunnies"" from therecord?""","Confidence, Disgust, Frustration"
"Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?","Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
"Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.","Happiness, Excitement, Nostalgia"
"Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for anannulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce.","Confidence, Neutral, Frustration"
"(stands up) That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did withyour funny, funny form!","Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
(stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated likebunnies nonsense!,"Anger, Surprise, Frustration"
And what—(notices the stenographer is still typing)—What are youtyping that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’ttype that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and inthe process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (He’s still typing.)Stop typing! Stop typing!!,"Anger, Confusion, Frustration"
"(to the judge) Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping memarried too?!","Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
You need to get out of my chambers.,"Confidence, Anger, Frustration"
"All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and Iam not leaving here until I get one!","Anger, Frustration"
Yeah!,"Happiness, Excitement, Optimism"
Would you like to spend the night in jail?,"Neutral, Surprise, Confusion"
And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.),Neutral
(entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took hiscar back.,"Confidence, Surprise, Frustration"
But you found the keys to his clothes?,"Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
"No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks Iown a Porsche.","Confidence, Excitement, Longing"
And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing theclothes?,"Confidence, Disgust, Frustration"
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have thecar! Right?,"Confidence, Disgust, Frustration"
That is true.,"Contentment, Confidence, Neutral"
"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.","Confidence, Surprise, Excitement"
"Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. (Starts toleave.)","Confidence, Excitement"
"Joey, you know you don’t actually have one.","Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk toher! (Storms out.),"Anger, Confusion, Frustration"
"Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.","Fear, Surprise, Frustration"
"All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.","Fear, Frustration"
"What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them!We’re baby-sitting!","Anger, Fear, Frustration"
"The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own fora while!","Contentment, Confidence"
But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team!We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!,"Fear, Frustration"
"He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got togo to the hospital.",Fear
"But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s justgonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.","Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
I think that’s gum.,Neutral
I’m pretty sure it’s gun.,"Confidence, Fear, Frustration"
"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.","Neutral, Sadness, Frustration"
"A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital! (They don’tstop.) No! What would, what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)","Anger, Fear, Frustration"
Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?,Frustration
Maybe because you’ve got the keys?,"Confidence, Surprise, Optimism"
(to women passing him) Porsche.,"Confidence, Excitement, Optimism"
This is totally your fault!,"Anger, Frustration"
My fault?! You threatened the judge!,"Anger, Surprise, Frustration"
"Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!","Anger, Surprise, Frustration"
That was the only way I could get him to,"Neutral, Frustration, Optimism"
Hi! How are the Gellers?,"Happiness, Contentment, Love"

But my apartment!,"Sadness, Frustration, Longing"
Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.,"Happiness, Contentment, Excitement"
But the mess!,"Neutral, Disgust, Frustration"
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babiesall by herself.,"Contentment, Confidence, Neutral"
"You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out.‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!","Excitement, Anticipation, Confusion"
