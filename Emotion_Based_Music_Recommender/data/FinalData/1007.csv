Seriously?,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"

That’s crazy! (Phoebe looks bewildered). I am sorry. I just can’t   imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!,"Sadness, Confusion, Frustration"
"We, you know, we’re different! We don’t care about having   a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you, but, oh,   please, I put this on? (she puts it on) And, ow, I look (she looks her reflex   image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause) All right, well, who cares,   I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.","Confidence, Disgust, Frustration"

We’re seriously asking for our money back?,"Surprise, Disgust, Frustration"
"It’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight,   because one of us gonna have to start flirting.","Happiness, Excitement, Anticipation"

"The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it   back.","Sadness, Anger, Frustration"
Excuse me?,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"
"Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t   want, but it turns out we do.","Happiness, Excitement, Anticipation"
So you’re asking us to refund your donation to the children?,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"
Yeah! This feels really good.,"Happiness, Contentment, Excitement"
"I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.","Sadness, Frustration, Longing"
"Hey, it’s not my business, (he takes their check from a   drawer) besides it’s probably a good thing. We really would have been   spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing…","Contentment, Neutral, Frustration"
"Hey, that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important!   And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t   go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an   escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me”   or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty   little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out)","Anger, Frustration"
She could have been talking about either one of us.,"Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
"Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.","Confidence, Excitement, Anticipation"

Your place is just lovely.,"Happiness, Contentment, Love"
"Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.","Contentment, Nostalgia, Optimism"
"You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples   in the","Surprise, Nostalgia, Confusion"

"But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.","Happiness, Contentment, Optimism"
Oh...,"Neutral, Surprise, Confusion"
What?,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"
I just realized why I remember this place.,"Surprise, Excitement, Nostalgia"
Really? What is it?,"Surprise, Excitement, Anticipation"
"Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building   and it","Excitement, Nostalgia"
Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?,"Happiness, Surprise, Excitement"
Yes!,"Happiness, Excitement, Optimism"

"Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it.   That is","Anger, Fear, Frustration"
"No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault   and kind","Sadness, Confusion, Frustration"
"Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else   gets","Fear, Frustration"
"No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing,   okay? And","Excitement, Anticipation, Optimism"
(looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... You've   always been,"Anger, Frustration"

What's going on?,"Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"
"WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!","Happiness, Contentment, Confidence"
Everything doesn't sound fine!,"Sadness, Anger, Frustration"
Is he alright out there by himself?,Fear
Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.,"Happiness, Contentment, Excitement"
Bert and Ernie!,"Happiness, Love, Excitement"
(nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!,"Surprise, Excitement, Optimism"
"You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm   sorry about","Surprise, Disgust"

"Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really   deserve that.","Happiness, Contentment, Excitement"
"Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for   a few","Sadness, Nostalgia, Longing"
"No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.","Anger, Fear, Frustration"
"Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.","Sadness, Disgust, Frustration"
"Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.","Neutral, Frustration"
"And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't   shot","Confidence, Fear, Frustration"
"Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child   in.","Happiness, Contentment, Optimism"
"Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the   furniture,","Contentment, Confidence, Neutral"
"Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything   I need","Confidence, Neutral, Anticipation"

What the hell are you doing?,"Anger, Confusion, Frustration"
"Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.",Confusion
"Well, we're not.","Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!,"Fear, Surprise, Confusion"
We don't have a code word.,"Neutral, Confusion, Frustration"
"We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word   for danger.","Confidence, Anticipation, Optimism"
So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey   behind,"Neutral, Frustration"
